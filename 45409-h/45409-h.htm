<h2>"FRAGI AGRESTES."</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-l.jpg" width="71" height="116" alt="L" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi4">"LET'S have a club," said Will Post to
a group of his schoolmates; "we can
meet once a week in some place, and
have a motto, and a password, and
everything, just like the big clubs."</div>

<p>"Agreed!" shouted the boys. "What shall
we call ourselves?"</p>

<p>"The Do-Nothing Club," some one suggested;
"we aren't going to do anything, only
have all the fun we can."</p>

<div class='poem'>
Have all the fun you can,<br />
In all the ways you can,<br />
In all the places you can,<br />
With all the people you can,<br />
And as long as ever you can.<br />
</div>

<p>"We can have that for our motto," said one
of the boys.</p>

<p>"Well, we only have a few minutes before
the bell will ring: let's elect officers."</p>

<p>So Will tore a few pages out of his note-book,
and after some officers had been nominated,
each one wrote the names of those he
wanted, on his slip. The results were just being
announced when the school-bell rang.</p>

<p>"The first meeting of the Do-Nothing Club
will be held in our yard to-morrow afternoon,"
called Will Post, who had been elected president
of the new organization.</p>

<p>So the next afternoon, immediately after
school, ten boys wended their way through the
back gate of Mr. Post's yard, and seated themselves
on the woodpile.</p>

<p>"I know where we will go," said Will, "right
out in the orchard in the boughs of those two
gnarly old apple-trees that just touch." Everyone
thought this a splendid plan, so soon the
ten boys were in different places in the two
great apple-trees in the orchard.</p>

<p>"Has any one a suggestion to make as to the
first adventure of the Do-Nothing Club?" said
the president, by way of opening the meeting.</p>

<p>"I have," said George Shaw, the treasurer of
the club. "You know Mr. Clay's pasture?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" they all said.</p>

<p>"Well, it's just chock-full of daisies and wild
strawberries, and I move that next Saturday
we ask him if we can get some daisies, and
each take a big basket and get it most full of
strawberries with a few daisies on top, to make
it look all right, you know;" and George
chuckled.</p>

<p>"I think it is a splendid plan, worthy of our
honorable treasurer," said President Post. A
vote was taken, which was almost unanimous in
favor of George's proposition, although there
were a few demurs made at first on the ground
of it's not being "quite honest."</p>

<p>"Honest!" sneered Will, "as if it wasn't all
right to refresh ourselves in a big meadow,
with what's there, free as grass!" So the objections
were silenced, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that Mr. Post's orchard
and Mr. Clay's farm were only separated by a
high board fence. Close by this fence grew quite
a little coarse grass, and as Mr. Clay thought it
took too much room, on this very afternoon on
which the Do-Nothing Club held their first
meeting, he had taken his scythe and spade, and
had gone to cut and dig up the offending material.
The day was very hot, and he grew so
tired and warm that he determined to lie down
in the shade by the fence for a few minutes.
But while lying there, he fell into a little doze,
and was only awakened by the laughter of the
boys as they climbed up the trees, getting
seated for the meeting. He lay awake for a few
moments, trying to make up his mind to arise,
and consequently heard the conversation in the
apple-tree, in which he became not a little interested.</p>

<p>Just here I must stop and explain that Mr.
Clay knew his meadow was very productive of
wild strawberries, and had said to his son, a few
days before the time at which my story begins:</p>

<p>"James, there will probably be a quantity of
strawberries in the meadow this summer, and if
you pick them, you can sell them at a good
price, which will bring you considerable spending
money. Do you want to try it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" had been the reply, and so it
was planned that in about a week James should
pick his strawberries, and have the money for
his "very own."</p>

<p>To go back now to the new club, I may say
that the next Friday afternoon (after the apple-tree
meeting) the ten boys appeared at Mr.
Clay's door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Clay," said the president, "we've
formed a new club lately&mdash;the Do-Nothing
Club, of which I'm the president, and George
is treasurer. We decided that the first thing
we'd do would be to pick some daisies out of
your meadow, that is, if you would let us. You
don't use them for anything, do you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said the gentleman, heartily;
"you are perfectly welcome to pick just as
many as you want. But don't step on any
more wild strawberries than you can help."</p>

<p>"We'll be careful," said Will, so he nodded
good-morning, and the club marched away.
"Indeed we won't step on them," he added,
when they were out of hearing, "we want the
use of them, and it won't do to destroy them."</p>

<p>So bright and early the next morning the
club marched to Mr. Clay's meadow, each member
armed with a basket, with a good-sized pail
inside. They were to fill the pails with berries,
and completely cover them with daisies. They
worked hard all the morning. About ten
o'clock James Clay said to his father, "I guess
I'll go out and help. They must be having
great fun."</p>

<p>"No, my boy," said Mr. Clay, with a twinkle
in his eye, "I would rather not."</p>

<p>When the town clock struck one, the boys
had searched the meadow so thoroughly that
there was hardly a berry in it, and their pails
were nearly all full! Then they went into the
woods back of the meadow to rest and take
their fill of the fresh fruit. Now you who have
no idea of the capacity of boys' stomachs, especially
for berries, would hardly believe me if I
should state the exact amount that those boys
devoured! So I will not give it. Suffice it to
say that there were <i>some</i> which they had to
throw away, having no place to put them for
safe-keeping, and not daring to share them with
anyone, for in that case, as Will said, "the cat
would be out of the bag." So it came to pass
that the rapid river which flowed through
Snyvylville could have told, if it had chosen,
how one part of it was dyed as red as blood
that afternoon, and how it looked as if some
awful deed had been done there, until the
<i>strawberries</i> were all washed down stream.</p>

<p>On Saturday evening, divers little girls went
about the streets of Snyvyville with pails of
wild strawberries, and the mothers or fathers of
every one of the members of the Do-Nothing
Club, happened to buy some of them for the
Sunday dinner. But in each family there was
great amazement because the boy or boys
thereof would eat no berries, and because each
boy had the headache and stomachache all day.
"I don't believe it was good for you to be out
in the sun so long," said Mrs. Post to Will, as
she put a fresh cloth dipped in ice-water, on his
head. He made no reply, for he knew that it
was not the exposure to the sun that gave him
the headache, but&mdash;quarts of wild strawberries!
Too much of a good thing is worse than none
at all.</p>

<p>"James dear," said Mrs. Clay to her husband
on Saturday evening, after James, Jr., had gone
to bed, "I don't believe it will be wise for
Jamie to pick all those berries out in the meadow.
Couldn't you get somebody to pick them, at
two cents a quart? That would leave him quite
a good deal of money. The sun is so hot, I am
afraid he would get sunstruck."</p>

<p>"I think that will be all right," said Mr.
Clay, looking earnestly at his newspaper; "I
don't suppose you would mind at all if the person
we hired did get sunstruck?"</p>

<p>His wife laughed, but turned again to her
mending, and said no more.</p>

<p>On Monday afternoon Mr. Clay went out to
continue the work of banishing the aforesaid
offensive grass from the face of the earth, but
lay down again as he saw, through a crack in
the fence, the Do-Nothing Club wending its
way toward the apple-trees where it was to
meet to talk over the success of the strawberry
plan.</p>

<p>"Twenty quarts!" ejaculated George Shaw,
"that was pretty good. I hardly thought there
would be so many. Wasn't my plan splendid,
though, Will&mdash;oh! I beg your pardon, Mr.
President?"</p>

<p>"Fine!" said the president; "all that you
planned for was, anyhow, for I don't suppose
you calculated for ten headaches and ten
stomachaches, as well as ten pails of berries,
did you? As nearly as I can find out, the other
members of the club have suffered in these
ways, like myself."</p>

<p>There was a good deal more talk; they decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
what should be their password, and a
great many other private matters. They would
have been very much disgusted, I am certain, if
they had guessed that Mr. Clay was intently
listening to everything that was said. Their
motto was to be "Fragi Agrestes," because, as
John Clower, the only Latin student of the
club, announced, that meant "wild strawberries."
Of course that was to be used as the
password, too. The seal was to be a leaf of
that plant, while the color of the club was to
be red.</p>

<p>When they went home, Mr. Clay got up and
went to work again, but he didn't work as well
as usual, for he had a plan in which he was
more interested than he was in demolishing the
grass. When he got home he sat down and
wrote some sort of a letter which he sealed with
a piece of red sealing-wax, and a button which
he had found in his wife's button-box.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that on Tuesday morning,
when George Shaw went to the post-office to
get the mail, he found a big yellow envelope
addressed to him. It had a red seal, on which
there was stamped the outline of a strawberry
leaf. He looked at it in amazement, for the
writing was strange. He found the document
inside to be sealed with the same seal. I will
give you a copy of it:</p>

<p>George stopped on the street in perfect amazement!
Then rushed to school, for the last bell
was ringing.</p>

<p>At recess, he called a meeting of the club,
and showed them the document he had received.</p>

<p>Then there were grave faces and anxious discussions.
How <i>could</i> Mr. Clay have found
them out?</p>

<p>At last the president said:</p>

<p>"Well, we'll just have to pay him; there is
no help for it. Every one of the club must hand
over twenty-six cents for his share. Here's
another thing we didn't plan for in the strawberry
idea. For my part, I wish 'Fragi Agrestes'
had never been invented."</p>

<p>The club marched that very afternoon, in a
body, to Mr. Clay's house to pay their bill. No
willing delegate was found to represent them.
Once there, the president had to make the
speech.</p>

<p>"We've brought you your money, Mr. Clay.
We can't imagine how you found us out; but
we hadn't the least notion of stealing! Somehow
it never entered our heads that it could be
<i>stealing</i>, to help ourselves to wild strawberries.
I never thought of such a thing until I saw
your bill. There it is. Will you please receipt
it? And we'll promise you we won't be likely
to get caught in such a scrape again."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the farmer, putting the
money in his pocket, and taking up a pen to
receipt the bill. "Boys, I'm not so anxious for
money that I had to have my pay for the berries
you stole. But I thought it would teach
you a lesson; so I sent the bill to the treasurer.
And now I want to advise you to take a new
name for your club, for you won't prosper under
the present one. When you aren't planning
to do anything but have fun, you'll get into
mischief.</p>

<div class='poem'>
Satan finds some mischief still<br />
For idle hands to do.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Change your name to the Do-Something Club,
and you'll not regret it."</div>

<p>"I'm agreed," said Will; "and I'll resign. I
have an idea. Suppose you be our president,
Mr. Clay?"</p>

<p>"I!" laughed the farmer.</p>

<p>"Good for you, Will," said the boys.
"That's a first-class idea. Will you do it, Mr.
Clay?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Clay, after a moment's consideration,
"I don't know but I'll accept. It is
quite an honor. President of the Snyvyville
Do-<i>Something</i> Club!" and he laughed again.</p>

<p>I wish I had time to tell you the story of the
new club! Under Mr. Clay's presidency, they
prospered; and became proud of their club.
True to their name, they "did" many things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
which were for their good, not only, but for the
good of others.</p>

<p>Some day I may write out their story, or a
piece of it.</p>

<p>They grew to be very fond of their president,
as well as very proud of his schemes.</p>

<p>The Do-Nothing Club had but one report in
the note-book of their secretary:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the Snyvyville Do-Nothing
Club change its name to the "Do-Something
Club," as it has not prospered under the former
title, but has been the cause of ten headaches,
ten stomachaches, and the loss of two dollars
and sixty cents, to the members thereof.</p>

for they thought that "wild strawberries"
had taught them a lesson they would not soon
forget.</p>

for reasonable people. I'll tell you the story,
and see what you think about it.</p>

<p>"It was the afternoon before the Fourth, and
everybody in our house was very busy. There
was to be a great celebration the next day, the
largest which had ever been in that part of the
world. The speaker was to stop at our house,
and several of the leading men were coming to
take supper with him, and in the evening there
was to be fireworks, great wonderful fire balls,
such as we don't see now-days, and fine doings
of all sorts.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 564px;">
<img src="images/illus014.jpg" width="564" height="467" alt="girl leaning against mother two men looking on" />
<div class="caption">"ME TUMBLING OVER AGAINST MOTHER."</div>
</div>

<p>"By the middle of the afternoon, mother
began to look very tired. I can seem to see her
face now, as she stood looking at the sideboard
with its rows of shining dishes. 'That drawer
ought to be cleared out,' said she, 'and fixed for
the changes of knives, and forks, and spoons,
but I don't know who can do it; everybody's
hands are full and it is full of all sorts of things.'
She wasn't speaking to anybody in particular,
just talking low, to herself. I was only a little
girl eight years old, and not supposed to notice
all that was going on. But I heard it, and
decided then and there, that as soon as my
mother went out I would set to work at that
drawer myself. And I did. It was a hard
drawer to clear out; one of those places where in
a hurried time things get put that don't belong,
and you don't exactly know where they <i>do</i>
belong. I worked away at it faithfully, until
my back ached with stooping, and every nerve
in my body seemed to be on the jump. Over
in the corner sat my grandfather, talking with
an old friend of his. They did not notice me,
but I heard snatches of their talk, about the
grand doings which were to be on the next day,
and it seemed to me I could hardly wait. My
work was almost done, and I was busy with the
thought of how pleased mother would be, when
I took up a long delicate glass bottle filled with
some liquid. The glass was so thin I tried to
look through it; as I held it up against the light,
my hands must have been trembling with weariness
and eagerness, for somehow, I never could
understand how, that bottle slipped from me
and shivered to bits on the hard floor! The
liquid spilled over my hands and spattered on
my face and eyes, and in an instant they began
to burn as though they were in a flame of fire!
To make matters worse, I clapped both hands,
all wet as they were, right on my eyes. This
made the pain more dreadful than ever. It all
happened in a moment of time: the scream, and
mother running, and grandfather springing up,
and me tumbling over against mother, and hearing
her say with a groan: 'Oh Ruthie, Ruthie!
she has put out her eyes!'</p>

<p>"Then for a few blessed minutes I was free
from pain; I fainted dead away for the first
time in my life! The faint didn't last long;
the pain in my eyes was too great. Oh! it was
a dreadful time. Father went hurrying after
the doctor, and mother tried cold water, and
milk, and bran-water, and everything else she
could think of, to relieve my suffering."</p>

<p>"But, Grandma, what was it? What had you
done?" interrupted Marion, her face pale with
sympathy.</p>

<p>"There was some dreadful liquid in the bottle,
dear, that had burned grandma's eyes, and
her skin, wherever it touched, and the doctor
was afraid my eyes were put out. Mother said
afterwards that she knew he thought so, by the
look on his face, and by his refusing to answer
her questions.</p>

<p>"He put something on, at last, which relieved
the pain a little, then my eyes were bandaged,
and I was put to bed. My dear mother, when
she stooped down to kiss me after everything
was done, did not forget to whisper that I was
a dear little girl to try to help mother, and that
the drawer looked beautiful.</p>

<p>"I sat up to the supper table that very night,
but with bandaged eyes that ached a good deal,
and every one at the table wore a sober face;
I could tell, by the sound of their voices. I
don't know whether father just <i>happened</i> to read
those verses at family worship, that night, or
whether the trouble made him think of them.
However it was, he read the story of the blind
man who was cured; and who, when the people
questioned and <i>questioned</i> him, could give only
this answer: 'One thing I know, that whereas
I was blind, now I see.'</p>

<p>"Father's voice trembled over the word
'blind,' and mother cried; I could feel her tears
dropping on my hand. But I did not shed a
tear; my heart was full of a great thought.
Jesus had cured that blind man with a touch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and my Bible verse the Sunday before, had
been 'Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day,
and forever.' Why couldn't he cure people in
just the same way now? Why didn't he? Perhaps
he did, only I had never heard of it.
Father's prayer made the thought all the
stronger. He asked the Lord to bless their
little girl, and, if it was possible, to take away
the fear which was gnawing at their hearts. He
didn't think I would understand. Mother did
not know she had screamed out that I had put
out my eyes. But I heard her. I knew all
about it. I remembered the time when the dog
slipped his chain and came and saved me; I
thought God sent him; and God could in some
way cure me now. Every waking minute that
night I prayed to him to cure me. The first
thing I did in the morning was to pray the
same prayer. I will not deny that I thought
about the beautiful fire balls, and all the wonders
of the evening, and I asked God, since he
could do it just as well, to cure me <i>quick</i>, so I
could see all the lovely things.</p>

<p>"Well, children," Grandma dropped her
knitting, and, leaning forward, folded her soft
white hands over her knee in an impressive way
she had, and looked her attentive little audience
squarely in the face, "I don't know how it was;
I don't pretend to explain it, never have, but
when the doctor came that morning, and said
he must take off the bandages to bathe my
eyes, and warned me that the light would hurt
very much, and I must try to be brave, and
told my mother that when he saw my eyes, he
could give her an idea of how many months I
would have to wear the bandage, and when
everything was ready, and mother had me in
her arms, and father sat the other side, and held
my hand, and the doctor unpinned the bandage,
I looked straight at father with two eyes that
did not even wink, and said: 'Father, they
don't hurt a bit; <i>not a single bit</i>.'</p>

<p>"Why, we had almost as much of a time
then as he had had the night before! That
doctor couldn't seem to believe it; he was
determined my eyes should burn, and sure that
I could not see father's face. But I saw everything
as plain as I do this minute. And my
eyes did not hurt at all. I continued to <i>see</i> all
day; and at night saw the fire balls, and laughed
and made merry with the rest. The happiest
girl, I do believe, that ever sat down to a
Fourth of July feast. I believed that the dear
Lord had touched my eyes and cured them."</p>

<p>"But, Grandma," said skeptical Ralph, "do
you <i>really</i> think it was so? Don't you suppose
the stuff in the bottle was weaker than they
thought, and the doctor's medicine, and the
night's sleep, cured your eyes?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Grandma, taking up her
knitting again; "all I know, is this: the stuff
burned so that I thought for a minute the whole
of me was on fire; and when I came out of my
faint, and tried to look up at mother, I couldn't
see a thing! And they all believed that if my
eyesight was not quite gone, it would be months
and <i>months</i> before I could see again; and never,
so well as before. And I know that in the
morning when the bandage was taken off, I
could see a good deal better than I can now,
and my eyes never ached a bit from it afterwards.
It is a little piece of the old story.
Grandma can't explain it, couldn't then; 'One
thing I knew; that whereas I was blind, now I
see.'"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-o.jpg" width="57" height="112" alt="O" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">ONE bright and never-to-be-forgotten day,
Nettie and Jerry stood together in the
"new" room and surveyed with intense
satisfaction all its appointments. They
were ready to begin business. On that
very evening the room was to be "open to the
public!" They looked at each other as they
repeated that large-sounding phrase, and laughed
gleefully.</div>

<p>There had been a great deal to do to get
ready. Hours and even days had been spent in
planning. It astonished both these young people
to discover how many things there were to
think of, and get ready for, and guard against,
before one could go into business. There was
a time when with each new day, new perplexities
arose. During those days Jerry had spent
a good deal of his leisure in fishing; both because
at the Smiths, and also at the Deckers,
fish were highly prized, but also because, as he
confided to Nettie, "a fellow could somehow
think a great deal better when his fingers were
at work, and when it was still everywhere about
him."</p>

<p>There were times, however, when his solitude
was disturbed. There had been one day in
particular when something happened about
which he did not tell Nettie. He was in his
fishing suit, which though clean and whole was
not exactly the style of dress which a boy would
wear to a party, and he stood leaning against a
rail fence, rod in hand, trying to decide whether
he should try his luck on that side, or jump
across the logs to a shadier spot; trying also to
decide just how they could manage to get another
lamp to stand on the reading table, when
he heard voices under the trees just back of
him.</p>

<p>They were whispering in that sort of penetrating
whisper that floats so far in the open
air, and which some, girls, particularly, do not
seem to know can be heard a few feet away.
Jerry could hear distinctly; in fact unless he
stopped his ears with his hands he could not
help hearing.</p>

<p>And the old rule, that listeners never hear any
good of themselves, applied here.</p>

<p>"There's that Jerry who lives at Smiths,"
said whisperer number one, "do look what a
fright; I guess he has borrowed a pair of Job
Smith's overalls! Isn't it a shame that such a
nice-looking boy is deserted in that way, and
left to run with all sorts of people?"</p>

<p>"I heard that he wasn't deserted; that his
father was only staying out West, or down
South, or somewhere for awhile."</p>

<p>"Oh! that's a likely story," said whisperer
number one, her voice unconsciously growing
louder. "Just as if any father who <i>was</i> anybody,
would leave a boy at Job Smith's for months,
and never come near him. I think it is real
mean; they say the Smiths keep him at work
all the while, fishing; he about supports them,
and the Deckers too, with fish and things."</p>

<p>At this point the amused listener nearly forgot
himself and whistled.</p>

<p>"Oh well, that's as good a way as any to
spend his time; he knows enough to catch fish
and do such things, and when he is old enough, I
suppose he will learn a trade; but I must say I
think he is a nice-looking fellow."</p>

<p>"He would be, if he dressed decently. The
boys like him real well; they say he is smart;
and I shouldn't wonder if he was; his eyes
twinkle as though he might be. If he wouldn't
keep running with that Decker girl all the time,
he might be noticed now and then."</p>

<p>At this point came up a third young miss who
spoke louder. Jerry recognized her voice at once
as belonging to Lorena Barstow. "Girls, what
are you doing here? Why, there is that Irish
boy; I wonder if he wouldn't sell us some fish?
They say he is very anxious to earn money; I
should think he would be, to get himself some
decent clothes. Or maybe he wants to make
his dear Nan a present."</p>

<p>Then followed a laugh which was quickly
hushed, lest the victim might hear. But the
victim had heard, and looked more than amused;
his eyes flashed with a new idea.</p>

<p>"Much obliged, Miss Lorena," he said softly,
nodding his head. "If I don't act on your hint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
it will be because I am not so bright as you give
me credit for being."</p>

<p>Then the first whisperer took up the story:</p>

<p>"Say, girls, I heard that Ermina did really
mean to invite him to her candy pull, and the
Decker girl too; she says they both belong to
the Sunday-school, and she is going to invite all
the boys and girls of that age in the school, and
her mother thinks it would not be nice to leave
them out. You know the Farleys are real
queer about some things."</p>

<p>Lorena Barstow flamed into a voice which
was almost loud. "Then I say let's just not
speak a word to either of them the whole evening.
Ermina Farley need not think that because
she lives in a grand house, and her father
has so much money, she can rule us all. I for
one, don't mean to associate with a drunkard's
daughter, and I won't be made to, by the Farleys
or anybody else."</p>

<p>"Her father isn't a drunkard now. Why,
don't you know he has joined the church? And
last Wednesday night they say he was in prayer
meeting."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, and what does that amount to? My
father says it won't last six weeks; he says
drunkards are not to be trusted; they never
reform. And what if he does? That doesn't
make Nan Decker anything but a dowdy, not
fit for us girls to go with; and as for that Irish
boy! Why doesn't Ermina go down on Paddy
Lane and invite the whole tribe of Irish if she
is so fond of them?"</p>

<p>"Hush, Lora, Ermina will hear you."</p>

<p>Sure enough at that moment came Ermina,
springing briskly over logs and underbrush.
"Have I kept you waiting?" she asked gayly.
"The moss was so lovely back there; I wanted
to carry the whole of it home to mother. Why,
girls, there is that boy who sits across from us
in Sabbath-school.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" she said pleasantly, for
at that moment Jerry turned and came toward
them, lifting his hat as politely as though it was
in the latest shape and style.</p>

<p>"Have you had good luck in fishing?"</p>

<p>"Very good for this side; the fish are not so
plenty here generally as they are further up.
I heard you speaking of fish, Miss Barstow,
and wondering whether I would not supply
your people? I should be very glad to do so,
occasionally; I am a pretty successful fellow so
far as fishing goes."</p>

<p>You should have seen the cheeks of the whisperers
then! Ermina looked at them, perplexed
for a moment, then seeing they answered only
with blushes and silence <i>she</i> spoke: "Mamma
would be very glad to get some; she was saying
yesterday she wished she knew some one of
whom she could get fish as soon as they were
caught. Have you some to-day for sale?"</p>

<p>"Three beauties which I would like nothing
better than to sell, for I am in special need of
the money just now."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Ermina promptly, "I am
sure mamma will like them; could you carry
them down now? I am on my way home and
could show you where to go."</p>

<p>"Ermina Farley!" remonstrated Lorena Barstow
in a low shocked tone, but Ermina only
said: "Good-by, girls, I shall expect you early
on Thursday evening," and walked briskly down
the path toward the road, with Jerry beside
her, swinging his fish. If the girls could have
seen his eyes just then, they would have been
sure that they twinkled.</p>

<p>They had a pleasant walk, and Ermina did
actually invite him to her candy-pull on Thursday
evening; not only that, but she asked if he
would take an invitation from her to Nettie
Decker. "She lives next door to you, I think,"
said Ermina, "I would like very much to have
her come; I think she is so pleasant and unselfish.
It is just a few boys and girls of our age,
in the Sunday-school."</p>

<p>How glad Jerry was that she had invited
them! He had been so afraid that her courage
would not be equal to it. Glad was he also to
be able to say, frankly, that both he and Nettie
had an engagement for Thursday evening; he
would be sure to give Nettie the invitation, but
he knew she could not come. Of course she
could not, he said to himself; "Isn't that our
opening evening?" But all the same it was
very nice in Ermina Farley to have invited
them.</p>

<p>"Here is another lamp for the table," said
Jerry gayly, as he rushed into the new room an
hour later and tossed down a shining silver
dollar. He had exchanged the fish for it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Then he sat down and told part of their story
to Nettie. About the whisperers, however, he
kept silent. What was the use in telling that?</p>

<p>But from them he had gotten another idea.
"Look here, Nettie, some evening we'll have a
candy-pull, early, with just a few to help, and
sell it cheap to customers."</p>

<p>So now they stood together in the room to
see if there was another thing to be done before
the opening. A row of shelves planed and
fitted by Norm were ranged two thirds of the
way up the room and on them were displayed
tempting pans of ginger cookies, doughnuts,
molasses cookies, and soft gingerbread. Sandwiches
made of good bread, and nice slices of
ham, were shut into the corner cupboard to
keep from drying; there was also a plate of
cheese which was a present from Mrs. Smith.
She had sent it in with the explanation that it
would be a blessing to her if that cheese could
get eaten by somebody; she bought it once, a
purpose as a treat for Job, and it seemed it
wasn't the kind he liked, and none of the rest
of them liked any kind, so there it had stood
on the shelf eying her for days. There was to
be coffee; Nettie had planned for that. "Because,"
she explained, "they <i>all</i> drink beer;
and things to eat, can never take the place of
things to drink."</p>

<p>It had been a difficult matter to get the
materials together for this beginning. All the
money which came in from the "little old
grandmothers," as well as that which Jerry contributed,
had been spent in flour, and sugar,
and eggs and milk. Nettie was amazed and
dismayed to find how much even soft gingerbread
cost, when every pan of it had to be
counted in money. A good deal of arithmetic
had been spent on the question: How low can
we possibly sell this, and not actually lose
money by it? Of course some allowance had
to be made for waste. "We'll have to name it
waste," explained Nettie with an anxious face,
"because it won't bring in any money; but of
course not a scrap of it will be wasted; but
what is left over and gets too dry to sell, we
shall have to eat."</p>

<p>Jerry shook his head. "We must sell it," he
said with the air of a financier. Then he went
away thoughtfully to consult Mrs. Job, and
came back triumphant. She would take for a
week at half price, all the stale cake they might
have left. "That means gingercake," he explained,
"she says the cookies and things will
keep for weeks, without getting too old."</p>

<p>"Sure enough!" said radiant Nettie, "I did
not think of that."</p>

<p>There were other things to think of; some of
them greatly perplexed Jerry; he had to catch
many fish before they were thought out. Then
he came with his views to Nettie.</p>

<p>"See here, do you understand about this firm
business; it must be you and me, you know?"</p>

<p>Nettie's bright face clouded. "Why, I
thought," she said, speaking slowly, "I thought
you said, or you meant&mdash;I mean I thought it
was to help Norm; and that he would be a
partner."</p>

<p>Jerry shook his head. "Can't do it," he
said decidedly. "Look here, Nettie, we'll get
into trouble right away if we take in a partner.
He believes in drinking beer, and smoking
cigarettes, and doing things of that sort; now
if he as a partner introduces anything of the
kind, what are we to do?"</p>

<p>"Sure enough!" the tone expressed conviction,
but not relief. "Then what <i>are</i> we to do,
Jerry? I don't see how we are going to help
Norm any."</p>

<p>"I do; quite as well as though he was a partner.
Norm is a good-natured fellow; he likes
to help people. I think he likes to do things
for others better than for himself. If we explain
to him that we want to go into this business,
and that you can't wait on customers, because
you are a girl, and it wouldn't be the thing, and
I can't, because it is in your house, and I promised
my father I would spend my evenings at
home, and write a piece of a letter to him every
evening; and ask him to come to the rescue
and keep the room open, and sell the things for
us, don't you believe he will be twice as likely
to do it as though we made him as young as
ourselves, and tried to be his equals?"</p>

<p>Then Nettie's face was bright. "What a contriver
you are!" she said admiringly. "I think
that will do just splendidly."</p>

<p>She was right, it did. Norm might have
curled his lip and said "pooh" to the scheme,
had he been placed on an equality; for he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
getting to the age when to be considered young,
or childish, is a crime in a boy's eyes. But to
be appealed to as one who could help the
"young fry" out of their dilemma, and at the
same time provide himself with a very pleasant
place to stay, and very congenial employment
while he stayed, was quite to Norm's mind.</p>

<p>And as it was an affair of the children's, he
made no suggestions about beer or cigars; it is
true he thought of them, but he thought at
once that neither Nettie or Jerry would probably
have anything to do with them, and as he
had no dignity to sustain, he decided to not
even mention the matter. These two planned
really better than they knew in appealing to
Norm for help. His curious pride would never
have allowed him to say to a boy, "We keep
cakes and coffee for sale at our house; come in
and try them." But it was entirely within the
line of his ideas of respectability to say: "What
do you think those two young ones over at our
house have thought up next? They have opened
an eating-house, cakes and things such as my
sister can make, and coffee, dirt cheap. I've
promised to run the thing for them in the evening
for awhile; I suppose you'll patronize
them?"</p>

<p>And the boys, who would have sneered at <i>his</i>
setting himself up in business, answered:
"What, the little chap who lives at Smith's?
And your little sister! Ho! what a notion!
I don't know but it is a bright one, though, as
sure as you live. There isn't a spot in this
town where a fellow can get a decent bite unless
he pays his week's wages for it; boys, let's
go around and see what the little chaps are
about."</p>

<p>The very first evening was a success.</p>

<p>Nettie had assured herself that she must not
be disappointed if no one came, at first.</p>

<div><img src="images/illus030a.jpg" alt="boy looking at distance" width="594" height="242" class="splitr" />
<img src="images/illus030b.jpg" alt="same boy same distance caption: TRYING TO DECIDE" width="275" height="390" class="splitr" />
</div>



<p>"You see, it is a new thing," she explained
to her mother, "of course it will take them a
little while to get acquainted with it; if nobody
at all comes to-night, I shall not be disappointed.
Shall you, Jerry?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Jerry, "I should; because I
know of one boy who is coming, and is going
to have a ginger-snap and a glass of milk. And
that is little Ted Locker who lives down the
lane; they about starve that boy. I shall like
to see him get something good. He has three
cents and I assured him he could get a brimming
glass of milk and a ginger-snap for that.
He was as delighted as possible."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" said Nettie, "I mean to tell
Norm to let him have two snaps, wouldn't
you?"</p>

<p>And Jerry agreed, not stopping to explain
that he had furnished the three cents with which
Ted was to treat his poor little stomach. So
the work began in benevolence.</p>

<p>Still Nettie was anxious, not to say nervous.</p>

<p>"You will have to eat soft gingerbread at
your house, for breakfast, dinner and supper, I
am afraid," she said to Jerry with a half laugh,
as they stood looking at it. "I don't know why
I made four tins of it; I seemed to get in a
gale when I was making it."</p>

<p>"Never you fear," said Jerry, cheerily. "I'll
be willing to eat such gingerbread as that three
times a day for a week. Between you and me,"
lowering his voice, "Sarah Ann can't make very
good gingerbread; when we get such a run of
custom that we have none left over to sell, I
wish you'd teach her how."</p>

<p>I do not know that any member of the two
households could be said to be more interested
in the new enterprise than Mr. Decker. He
helped set up the shelves, and he made a little
corner shelf on purpose for the lamp, and he
watched the entire preparations with an interest
which warmed Nettie's heart. I haven't said
anything about Mr. Decker during these days,
because I found it hard to say. You are acquainted
with him as a sour-faced, unreasonable,
beer-drinking man; when suddenly he became
a man who said "Good morning" when he came
into the room, and who sat down smooth shaven,
and with quiet eyes and smile to his breakfast,
and spoke gently to Susie when she tipped her
cup of water over, and kissed little Sate when
he lifted her to her seat, and waited for Mrs.
Decker to bring the coffee pot, then bowed his
head and in clear tones asked a blessing on the
food, how am I to describe him to you? The
change was something which even Mrs. Decker
who watched him every minute he was in the
house and thought of him all day long, could
not get accustomed to. It astonished her so
to think that she, Mrs. Decker, lived in a house
where there was a prayer made every night and
morning, and where each evening after supper
Nettie read a few verses in the Bible, and her
father prayed; that every time she passed her
own mother's Bible which had been brought out
of its hiding-place in an old trunk, she said,
under her breath, "Thank the Lord." No, she
did not understand it, the marvelous change
which had come over her husband. She had
known him as a kind man; he had been that
when she married him, and for a few months
afterwards.</p>

<p>She had heard him speak pleasantly to Norm,
and show him much attention; he had done
it before they were married, and for awhile
afterwards; but there was a look in his face,
and a sound in his voice now, such as she had
never seen nor heard before.</p>

<p>"It isn't Decker," she said in a burst of confidence
to Nettie. "He is just as good as he
can be; and I don't know anything in the world
he ain't willing to do for me, or for any of us;
and it is beautiful, the whole of it; but it is all
new. I used to think if the man I married
could only come back to me I should be perfectly
happy; but I don't know this man at
all; he seems to me sometimes most like an
angel."</p>

<p>Probably you would have laughed at this.
Joe Decker did not look in the least like the
picture you have in your mind of an angel;
but perhaps if you had known him only a few
weeks before, as Mrs. Decker did, and could
have seen the wonderful change in him which
she saw, the contrast might even have suggested
angels.</p>

<p>Nettie understood it. She struggled with
her timidity and her ignorance of just what
ought to be said; then she made her earnest
reply:</p>

<p>"Mother, I'll tell you the difference. Father
prays, and when people pray, you know, and
mean it, as he does, they get to looking very
different."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Decker did not pray.</p>

TWO cherubs were playing near Heaven's gate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which an angel had left ajar;</span><br />
They were toying each with small silver bells,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose soft chimes could be heard afar.</span><br />
<br />
As they tossed in play these musical toys,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some rolled through the half-open gate;</span><br />
And down from the high heavens blue they came<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through the clouds at a quickening rate.</span><br />
<br />
And when at last they fell down to this earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And rested in green fairy dell,</span><br />
Where each one had fallen there sprang a flower,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The beautiful, graceful Blue Bell.</span><br />
<br />
For as they came down through the azure skies,<br />

<h2>POEM FOR RECITATION.</h2>

<h3>TOMMY'S FOURTH OF JULY.</h3>

<div class='poem'><div class='drop-cap'>
YESTERDAY, mother, she said to me,<br />
"Now, Tommy, my man, it soon will be<br />
The Fourth of July, and I dread the noise&mdash;<br />
I dread the freedom of reckless boys,<br />
<br />
"The ringing of bells, the firing gun,<br />
Torpedoes and crackers, from sun to sun;<br />
I wonder if when those grand old men<br />
Declared for Freedom, it could have been<br />
<br />
"That they ever thought the boys of to-day<br />
Would celebrate in this lawless way.<br />
On other days boys seem nice and bright,<br />
I know that some of them try to do right,<br />
<br />
"But fired with the 'spirit of '76,'<br />
There seems to be never an end to their tricks.<br />
Now, Tommy my lad, just think it over<br />
And see if the <i>reason</i> you can't discover."<br />
<br />
So I'll pull my "thinking cap" over my hair<br />
And sit out here in this sunny air<br />
And try to remember last Fourth of July&mdash;<br />
Somehow it seems to be long gone by.<br />
<br />
At night, I remember, we rang the bell,<br />
And nobody liked it very well,<br />
And all day long I was far from bright<br />
For getting up in the dead of night.<br />
<br />
And then, we followed the "Horrible" train<br />
And yelled and shouted, and yelled again;<br />
We chased it up the street and then down,<br />
Chased it all over and out of the town.<br />
<br />
It must have been <i>awful</i>, but none of us cared<br />
How the rest of the decent people fared.<br />
Then somebody frightened old uncle Bill<br />
Just as he was walking down the hill,<br />
<br />
Threw a torpedo, only for fun;<br />
He fell and hurt him, that's all that was done.<br />
Then a horse got frightened, and ran away&mdash;<br />
That was one of the things that happened that day&mdash;<br />
<br />
Broke his leg, and broke the carriage too,<br />
And the crackers were thrown by Charley Drew;<br />
Charley's father must pay the bill,<br />
So I guess this year <i>he'll</i> keep pretty still.<br />
<br />
And Jimmy blew three of his fingers to bits&mdash;<br />
The way a toy pistol always hits;<br />
I ate so much I was nearly dead,<br />
And had a most awful pain in my head,<br />
<br />
And was just as tired as I could be&mdash;<br />
That was the way it finished with me.<br />
I think I've remembered 'bout enough;<br />
If that is fun, it is pretty "rough."<br />
<br />
I might go tell mother this very minute<br />
I don't see a bit of "reason" in it&mdash;<br />
I, Thomas, was named for the hero of all&mdash;<br />
That gentleman wouldn't own me at all.<br />
<br />
But I know I'll try to do better this year,<br />
If all the fellows do call me queer.<br />
This year, I, "Thomas Jefferson" Gray,<br />
Will celebrate in a rational way.<br />

<h2>WHERE I WENT, AND WHAT I SAW.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-w.jpg" width="127" height="135" alt="W" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi4">WE will start from New York City.
Did you ever take a ride on the
elevated railway? No? Then we
will take it this morning. Mount
the long flight of stairs, hurry your
ticket into the box in waiting, and
push on rapidly, for the train is coming, and it
is always in a hurry. There stands the man on
the platform, ready to open the iron door for
us. Spring on, get your seats, for others are
crowding in. Now the door is shut; "toot!
toot! whiz!" we are off again!</div>

<p>We make a great many stops. "Fourteenth
street," shouts the man at the gate, and there
is a rush of people to get off, and a rush of people
to get on, and away we go; and in almost
less time than it takes to get our breath, Twenty-third
street, or some other, is shouted, and we
stop again.</p>

<p>At last Forty-second street is called, and we
hurry off; everybody in New York is in a hurry.
Yet we have reached a quiet place; the New
York Central Depot. "A railroad depot a quiet
place!" That astonishes you, does it? Still it
is the truth; I am not sure but you would think
yourself in a great public library, where people
move quietly, and speak low. There is no rush,
nor bustle; and the room which we have entered
is so large that there can hardly be a crowd,
even when many people are there. Many doors
line one side, and large clock-faces are set over
them; but they keep curious time; no two are
alike. If you watch, however, you will discover
that the doors and the clocks are all
named. One is "N. Y. C. &amp; H. R." another is
"N. Y. &amp; N. H." and another is&mdash;something
else.</p>

<p>The hands of the clock point to the hour and
moment that the next train on that particular
road will be ready to leave the depot. All we
have to do is to look for the name of the road
on which we want to travel, and then study the
clock over the door. Here is ours, "N. Y. &amp;
N. H." We have still fifteen minutes. Before
that time, the door is quietly opened, and a man
whose duty it is to see that we, by no possibility,
make a blunder and board the wrong train,
takes his station behind it, and looks carefully
at our tickets as we pass; we are seated and
away.</p>

<p>The train moves very rapidly, and the sensation
is pleasant. No rocking motion, and not
nearly so much noise as we sometimes find.
We chat together pleasantly, without the feeling
that we are talking in a locomotive boiler,
where work is going on. We make frequent
stops at pleasant villages, where green fields
stretch out, on either side, and where the air is
sweet with the breath of flowers. One name is
called which makes us stretch our necks from
the open windows to get as good a view as we
can. This is New Haven, "the city of elms,"
and the seat of Yale College. It is a beautiful
city; we can be sure of that, even from the
depot view. But we have not time to linger.
Some day we will stop there, and take a walk
around the college. Now we must make all
speed to our destination. At last we hear the
name: "Ansonia." And we seize our wraps,
and satchels, and umbrellas, and lunch boxes,
and make haste. What a pretty village! And
what a strange one! The river cuts it in two;
makes another village on the other side, which,
after all, is the same village, or looks like it.
There are many trees, hiding nice old-fashioned
houses, near which we get glimpses of many
flowers. But the buildings which most attract
us to-day are not dwelling houses; unless indeed
a race of giants live in them. They are so
large! Manufactories? Yes, you have guessed
it; the State of Connecticut, you know, is
famous for its industry. We have spent so
much time in getting here, that we will not be
able to stay long in the great building to-day.
Still, let us stop a few minutes before this queer
machine; it is apparently eating wire. What a
stomach it must have! Long coils of fine wire
rush into its mouth with such speed that one
can hardly see the process. How fast it eats!
Such large mouthfuls as it takes! about eight
inches of wire at a bite. Now what? No, it
doesn't swallow the wire, it simply bites it off,
and sends it on. Not far, for as the wire is
scurrying by a corner, some one of the wicked
people who dwell in this machine, seizes it and
bends it double! Poor thing! But as you
would naturally expect, it hurries the faster
now. Not two inches away, it meets another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
enemy who in sheer ill humor, apparently, seizes
it and in an instant of time has given it such a
pinch that its right side is all crinkled; it will
bear the marks of that grasp all its life! It
scuds on, without a groan, intent apparently on
getting out of that country as soon as possible.
But no, it is seized again, and the two ends of
its poor body are rubbed hastily and mercilessly
against a rough surface, until they are like needles
for sharpness. It takes but a second, and
then the wicked sprite seems to have had
revenge enough, and lets the poor wire pass.
There is a little open place for which the wire
is evidently making; it hopes to slip down there
out of sight&mdash;hurry! almost there! Alas no,
one more sprite reaches out a long finger, and
gives that horrid pinch to the other side!
"Maimed for life!" the poor wire groans, and
at last, at <i>last</i>, having suffered a life-time of torture,
so it thinks, though really its whole journey
has not taken more than half a minute, it drops
breathless and exhausted into the box below.
Let us go around and look at it, poor thing!
Why, how it shines! And what a merry company
it has gotten among! Not alone any
more; literally millions of friends of the same
outward appearance as itself. "Hairpins!"
you exclaim. Yes, indeed; hairpins for the
million. Can it be possible that the world will
ever want them all? But how pretty they are;
and how smooth and fine their points are! Besides,
those horrible pinches which we thought
were simply vents for ill-humor, were to put
those convenient crinkles into the pins, and help
them perform their duty in life. In short, the
dabs, and pinches, and grindings, hard as they
were to bear, were the very things which shaped
a mere bit of wire into a useful member of
society.</p>

<p>And, when one thinks of it, what a bit of time
it took&mdash;this preparation&mdash;compared with the
time which they will now spend in usefulness!
No wonder the hairpins in the great box shone
brightly when at last they began to understand
it all. The question is, little Pansy Blossoms,
can you and I, as we stand looking at them, and
thinking of all this, learn a lesson which will
apply to our <i>human</i> rubs, and pinches, and
sharp places? If this be so, then we shall be
well repaid for going, and seeing, and thinking.</p>

<h2>"OLD ABE."</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-s.jpg" width="53" height="112" alt="S" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">SOME years ago a man in the West saw
an eagle lighting frequently upon a spot
high among the rocks. Observing her
movements he saw her nest was there
and she was raising her family in that
palace of rocks. "Now," he thought, "is the
time for me to find out if this grand bird can be
tamed." His neighbors said it could not be done.</div>

<p>He quietly resolved to try. But how to get
an eaglet was the question. Day after day he
would go alone and examine the rocks to see if
there was not some way of getting to the nest.
There seemed to be none. It was a ledge,
almost smooth, and one hundred feet high where
the nest was. No ladder would reach it, and
if he should go around and climb to the top,
he would not be near, as it was many feet down.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 286px;">
<img src="images/illus041.jpg" width="286" height="408" alt="Eagle watching over nest with some other bird with nest on ground" />
<div class="caption">THAT PALACE OF ROCKS.</div>
</div>
<p>One night as he lay thinking the thing over,
a thought struck him. "I will go to the top,
fasten a rope and let myself down and capture
one and climb up again."</p>

<p>In the morning he was a bit wiser and said:
"Now if something <i>should</i> happen while I am
down there pocketing a young eagle, I might
need both hands; in that case how could I climb
up? I'll tell the secret to John and Joe Grimes."
So they went around to the top of the ledge
where they could look over down to the nest.</p>

<p>The old eagle was gone; but there were the
five children, talking together at a great rate,
not thinking who were near by listening to their
conversation and about to knock at their door.</p>

<p>The next moment as they looked up they saw
a man coming down by a rope fastened about
his body. He seized one and was being drawn
up when suddenly the Mother Eagle seeing
from far away in the sky an enemy enter her
home, and, coming like a flash, dashed upon the
robber and would have torn his eyes out; but
he fought desperately with his long, sharp knife.</p>

<p>One of his blows almost severed the rope.
John and Joe, however, tugged bravely at the
other end and their friend with his prize was
soon safe but panting at their feet. It is said
that when he saw how nearly he came to cutting
the rope in two and falling a hundred feet,
his hair became instantly white from terror.</p>

<p>The young eagle was taken home and tenderly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
raised and became as tame as any fowl in the
barnyard. It grew to immense size&mdash;would
fly away out of sight among the clouds, but
always return at meal-time and behave like any
respectable person. He thought much of his
friends; not so much of his friends' enemies.
And he had his way of showing his friendship.</p>

<p>And now you need not be surprised to be
told about the queer things that the eagle,
"Old Abe," did in the War of the Rebellion
in 1861-65; how he actually went South with a
Western regiment in which were some of his
friends, and during battles would fly high and
hover over his favorite regiment to cheer it on!</p>

<p>After the battle he would come down and
walk among the soldiers and line with them.</p>

<p>The war over, he came back with his regiment
and was received like any loyal soldier, with
great honor; and his State appropriated a sum
to maintain him comfortably in his after years.</p>

<p>There are over thirty references in the Bible
to eagles. They are remarkable. A concordance
can point them all out. Hunt them up.</p>

<h2>A PACKAGE FOR ROSE.</h2>


<h3>NO. I.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="55" height="112" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">AUNT ALICE was going away for a
visit of two or three weeks.</div>

<p>Her trunk was on the little front
porch waiting for Farmer Dodds, whenever,
with his fat white horse and rattling
spring wagon he should make his appearance
coming over the hill.</p>

<p>Rose seated herself on the trunk, and lightly
tapping her heels against the side, looked off in
a dreamy way toward the dusty road that wound
down from among tree-covered hills, on its way
past their own white cottage with rose-vines
climbing over the small square windows, and so
prettily set down in the midst of an old-fashioned
garden, with a broad, straight path leading
from the gate to the porch, and at that
season bordered with asters of all colors.</p>

<p>Farmer Dodds was not in sight, and Rose,
now turning toward the left, followed with her
eyes the line of the road, where, having left the
slope of hill behind, it struck out across the
level. Stubble fields down there were yellow,
the green of the meadows was turning into a
soft pale brown, and far off the horizon was like
a rising mist of purple.</p>

<p>"Aunt Alice," said Rose, stopping the tapping
of her heels, "some way the sunshine down
yonder looks almost as if you could take it in
your hands."</p>

<p>"Tangible light?" said Miss Alice, coming to
the porch to look abroad.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Rose.</p>

<p>"Why, just the opposite of 'darkness that
could be felt', I think."</p>

<p>"Is it?" said Rose gravely. "But, aunt
Alice," she continued, "I wonder what I'll do
without you here to ask questions of. And how
will I ever get along without the Saturday
afternoon talks&mdash;I've got so used to them, you
know. I'll just be awfully lonesome."</p>

<p>"We'll have to plan a way to help that," returned
her aunt. "Let me see&mdash;how would
you like to write a letter to me on the first Saturday?
Only you must be careful to write
what you would be most apt to talk about if I
were here."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! I'd like to do that," interrupted Rose.</p>

<p>"And then," continued Miss Alice, "I could
have a little packet for you at the post-office.
Perhaps grandma would let you ride to town
with Mr. Dodds, when he goes for his mail, and
you could have the pleasure of getting the
packet yourself."</p>

<p>"That's a splendid idea!" cried Rose. "But
what will you put in the packet?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet," replied her aunt. "That
will depend upon the letter you write to me.
It may be some trifling present, or perhaps a
single Bible verse, such as I often give you on
Saturday evening. But of one thing you may
be sure, there will be something in it that will
be a true answer to your letter."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 556px;">
<img src="images/illus045.jpg" width="556" height="414" alt="Aunt Alice on train" />
<div class="caption">AUNT ALICE FAIRLY STARTED.</div>
</div>

<p>While they were talking Mr. Dodds' wagon
had come rattling up to the gate. Immediately
everything was in a bustle. Grandma came
out to see the trunk lifted into the wagon&mdash;aunt
Alice found that she had left her gloves
upstairs and must go after them at the last minute&mdash;and
there came Priscilla Carter running
up the road with a great bunch of bitter-sweet,
which Miss Alice was to take to a friend. Rose
thought it was delightful, and kept skipping up
and down the path, wishing all the time that
she were aunt Alice, with a new trunk and going
to have a trip on the cars. But at last
good-bys were said, the wagon rattled and
jingled off, and Mrs. Harrison, Rose and Priscilla
were left standing quietly by the white
picket gate in the pleasant autumn sunshine.</p>

<p>When Saturday afternoon came around Rose
asked her grandmother for pen and ink. Then
drawing a square writing-table out to the porch,
where it was shady, she began the task of writing
a letter that would tell all that had been
going on since her aunt went away. Mrs.
Harrison was sitting by the window sewing, and
for nearly an hour there was no sound save the
scratching of her little granddaughter's pen, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
now and then a question from her as to how a
word should be spelled.</p>

<p>But by and by Rose threw down her pen and
pushed her chair noisily back, exclaiming as she
did so:</p>

<p>"Well, grandma, I declare! I've got it done
at last! Wouldn't you like me to read it to
you?"</p>

<p>"Of course, dearie, I should like it very
much," answered Mrs. Harrison, glancing up
from her sewing.</p>

<p>So Rose sat down on the doorstep and began
to read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class='unindent'>
<span class="smcap">Dear Aunt Alice</span>:<br />
</div>

<p>I started to school Tuesday, and I'm awfully sorry I was not
there the first day, for my seat isn't one bit nice. I'd a <i>great
deal</i> rather have the one Altie Crawford is in. She can look
out the window and see everybody drive by. There's a real
hateful girl sits just behind me too. She is always twisting
my curls around her finger; or if she isn't doing that, why, she
is borrowing my white-handled knife&mdash;the one Mr. Dodds
gave me. Miss Milton has a new blue dress. Priscilla took
her a <i>great big</i> bunch of white chrysanthemums to put in her
belt, and she looked lovely. She is the meanest teacher, though,
that I ever had. She won't listen to a word you say to her,
and she makes me lend my eraser to everybody in school.</p>

<p>I don't think that's one bit nice of her, and its most worn
out, too! She just does it because it is a pretty one. There's a
new boy named Robert Wilkie, just started to school, and Miss
Milton pets him to death. She is always holding him up for
an example, but I think he don't know his lessons any better
than the rest of us. I told the girls that you were going to
send me a packet, and they were all as <i>excited</i> trying to guess
what would be in it!</p>

<p>I've been trying to be real good, and I help grandma wash
the dishes most every day, <i>especially</i> when she looks tired.
Last evening I got supper all by myself. I fried potato cakes.
The edges were a speck jagged, but they were just as brown
and nice!</p>

<p>Now I'll have to stop. I've thought and thought, but there
isn't anything else to write about. I wonder what you'll put
in the packet. I told Priscilla I most thought it would be a
ribbon. She's crazy to see what is in it.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">Your loving niece,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Rose</span>.<br />
</div>

<p>P. S. Priscilla says she can't bear that new boy either.
Miss Milton sent her love to you.</p></blockquote>

<p>"I think that is quite a nice letter," said Mrs.
Harrison, when Rose had come to the end. "But
however your aunt is to answer it is more than
I can guess."</p>

<p>"Don't it seem a long time to wait until
Saturday?" said Rose as she folded the letter
carefully and put it in an envelope which she
brought to her grandmother to address.</p>

<p>"The more patiently you wait the shorter the
time will seem," returned Mrs. Harrison.</p>

<p>Rose did wait patiently and cheerfully, and
on Saturday afternoon it was a happy girl who
rode home beside Farmer Dodds in the spring
wagon.</p>

<p>As they drew near the white picket gate she
saw Priscilla sitting on the horseblock.</p>

<p>"Have you got it?" cried Priscilla, jumping
down, and running to meet the wagon.</p>

<p>For answer Rose held up a square package
wrapped in white paper.</p>

<p>"I don't know yet what is in it," said Rose
when they drew nearer, "for grandma told me
not to open it until I got home. It feels flat,
and then there's something round, like a stick
of candy, only its pretty large."</p>

<p>The white horse had come to a decided stop
by this time and Priscilla held out her hand for
the package, while Rose clambered down from
the wagon.</p>

<p>"I thank you for the ride, Mr. Dodds," said
she, when she reached the ground, "and I'll tell
you what is in my packet the next time you
come by."</p>

<p>"All right," replied Mr. Dodds, with a sort
of merry chuckle, "but be a leetle careful how
ye open it. It <i>might</i> be candy, and it <i>might</i> be
red pepper."</p>

<p>So saying, he drove off uphill.</p>

<p>"There might be something you wouldn't
like," suggested Priscilla, looking a little doubtfully
at the package.</p>

<p>"O pshaw!" retorted Rose; "I know better
than that. Let's get the scissors."</p>

<h2>OUR ALPHABET OF GREAT MEN.</h2>

<h3>R.&mdash;RUSH, BENJAMIN.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-l.jpg" width="71" height="116" alt="L" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">LAST year, all over this land, we celebrated
a centennial. It was not in
commemoration of a victory upon the
battlefield, it was not the celebration
of a victory, but rather as we observe
with fitting ceremonies the anniversaries of the
firing of the first guns in any contest of right
against wrong, so in this last centennial year we
commemorated the first booming of cannon in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the great war against the rum traffic, the beginning
of a war that is not ended yet; all along
down the century the booming has been heard,
and to-day this moral fight is waging fiercely.</div>

<p>About one hundred and forty years ago, near
the city of Philadelphia, a boy named Benjamin
Rush was growing up. It is said of him that
as he advanced from childhood to boyhood his
love of study was unusual, amounting to a passion.
He graduated from Princeton College
when only fifteen years old, and with high
honors. He began the study of medicine in
Philadelphia, but went abroad to complete his
medical education and studied under the first
physicians in Edinburgh, London and Paris;
thus the best opportunities for gaining knowledge
of his chosen profession were added to
natural abilities and the spirit of research. He
became a practising physician in Philadelphia,
and was soon after chosen professor of chemistry
in a medical college in the same city. While
he is now at the distance of a century, best
known as one who struck the first blow for temperance
reform, yet it is interesting to know
that when in 1776, he was a member of the
Provincial Assembly of Pennsylvania, he was
the mover of the first resolution to consider the
expediency of a Declaration of Independence
on the part of the American Colonies. He was
made chairman of a committee appointed to
consider the matter. Afterwards he was a
member of the Continental Congress, and was
one of the devoted band who in Independence
Hall affixed their names to the immortal document
which cut the colonies loose from their
moorings and swung them out upon a sea of
blood, to bring them at last into the harbor of
freedom and independence. As was said of him
at the meeting in Philadelphia, last year: "He
was a great controlling force in all that pertained
to the successful struggle of the colonies for
national independence." We are told that "He
was one of the most active, original and famous
men of his times; an enthusiast, a philanthropist,
a man of immense grasp in the work-day world,
as well as a polished scholar, and a scientist of
the most exact methods."</p>

<p>He was interested in educational enterprises;
he wrote upon epidemic diseases, and won great
honor for himself, so that the kings of other
lands bestowed upon him the medals which they
are wont to give to those whom they desire to
honor. And now let me quote again from one
who appreciates the character of this truly great
man:</p>

<p>"This matchless physician, eminent scholar
and pure patriot blent all his wise rare gifts in
one tribute and cast them at the feet of his
Master. He was a devout Christian."</p>

<p>At length his soul was stirred within him as
he witnessed the increasing evils of intemperance,
and he wrote and published his celebrated
essay upon "The Effects of ardent Spirits upon
the Human Body and Mind, with an account of
the means of preventing them, and of the remedies
for curing them." This is said to have
been the first temperance treatise ever published&mdash;the
beginning of a temperance literature.
One hundred years ago, just one pamphlet of
less than fifty pages; now, whole libraries
of bound books, besides scores upon scores
of pamphlets, leaflets and many periodicals
devoted exclusively to the cause of temperance!
and nearly three quarters of a century after this
good man had gone to his rest, men and women
from all over the land thronged the city of his
birth "To recount the victories won in the war&mdash;and
to strike glad hands of fellowship."</p>

<p>And now what made Doctor Rush great?
What is the best thing said of him?</p>

</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">IF the young readers of <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> had
lived forty years ago, and had been
readers of the <i>New York Tribune</i>, they
would, without doubt, have been interested
in certain letters upon art and literature
written by Margaret Fuller; or, if you are so
fortunate as to belong to a grandfather who
stored away his files of the <i>Tribune</i> in some now
long-forgotten chest in the attic, you may find
in the old, yellow and musty papers these same
letters, and may read them now. I do not like
musty old papers very much! What's the use,
when we have fresh ones in such numbers that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
we cannot begin to read all that are taken by
the different members of the family?</div>

<p>Sarah Margaret Fuller was a native of Cambridgeport,
Mass. Very early in life she gave
promise of the brilliant literary career which
she afterwards ran. She was a fine scholar even
in childhood, especially in the languages, and in
general literature. Her education was carried
on in private. After she entered her teens, she
became a teacher of the languages in classes in
Boston, and in Mr. Alcott's school, and was at
one time the principal of a school in Providence.
While she was a contributor to the <i>Tribune</i>, she
was a member of the family of Horace Greeley.
Her views of life were modelled after the
philosophy of Ralph Waldo Emerson, and about
the year 1839, or 1840, she gave a series of lectures,
or talks, though I believe they were called
<i>conversazioni</i>, especially for ladies, the object
being the propagation of then somewhat novel
ideas. She also became the editor of a paper.
She wrote much, and with considerable brilliancy.
Her "Summer on the Lakes" gives
pictures of the Lake Superior region. Her
"Woman in the Nineteenth Century" has to
do with some phases of the "Woman's Rights
Question." In 1846 she went abroad, and married,
in Rome, a nobleman, Giovanni Angelo
Ossoli. But she bore the name and the title
attached to it only a few years. For when she
was returning to America, accompanied by her
husband, both lost their lives in a shipwreck.
She was a woman of strong passions, indeed it
has been said of her that "She was noted for
her eccentricities and her ungovernable passions."
Not just what I would wish to be
written of any of my young friends of <span class="smcap">The
Pansy</span>. It is a sad thing when a great and
gifted woman misses the happiness of a quiet
spirit.</p>

<p>"Allen, it's no use to pretend that I'm not in
an awful scrape by that little affair over at
Sachem Hill. Goodness! why don't you speak
to a chap?"</p>

<p>"I've nothing to say," observed St. George,
proceeding with his work.</p>

<p>"Your tongue is ready enough generally,"
retorted Wilfred in a temper. "Now, if it
suits you to be an oyster, it don't me. I'd
rather you'd preach, infinitely."</p>

<p>"I don't do that," cried St. George, throwing
down knife and stick, and turning a countenance
by no means saintly upon his visitor. "You
sha'n't stand there and throw that at me," he
declared in a heat.</p>

<p>"I didn't say you did," said Wilfred coolly,
"I only said I'd rather you would. So go on."</p>

<p>"It's none of my business what you do,"
cried St. George, "I'm not going to say a word
about it."</p>

<p>"Confound you!" cried Wilfred irritably,
flinging his long figure on the bench amongst
the shavings, and pushing aside the tools that
lay in the way. "Well, hear me, then&mdash;I'm in
for it, and no mistake. Father is so angry just
because I didn't report in time that night, that
he threatens to pack me off to boarding-school.
In fact, it's as good as decided, and I go next
week. Now, you've got the whole."</p>

<p>He threw himself down to the floor as abruptly,
plunged his hands in his pockets, and
walked to the window.</p>

<p>St. George stood aghast, looking after him.</p>

<p>"Did your mother say so?" he asked at
length, hoping, from his knowledge of the Bangs
family, that a reprieve might yet arrive from
the true head of affairs there.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Wilfred gloomily, "she's worse
than father about it, and determined that he
sha'n't give in." St. George looked pityingly at
him.</p>

<p>"Well, it can't be helped," he said, longing
to bestow something better.</p>

<p>"Of course it can't," cried Wilfred, whirling
around; "a plague upon you for saying that."</p>

<p>"You wanted me to say something," contributed
St. George.</p>

<p>"I know it. But why don't you say 'I told
you so,' or, 'If you hadn't been a first-class idiot
you'd have dropped that last confounded skate!'
Then I could fight you. As it is now, there
isn't anything to strike against."</p>

<p>"I'm as sorry as you are," said St. George
dubiously, overlooking his ill-success in the
matter of conversationally pleasing his friend;
"whatever shall I do without you?" There was
such genuine regret in his voice and manner,
that Wilfred forgot his irritation, and began
to look mollified.</p>

<p>"We've had awful good times," he said, coming
up to the work-bench again.</p>

<p>"I should think we had," declared St. George
in that hearty way of his that made all the boys
willing to call him "capital."</p>

<p>"And it's perfectly horrid to begin again
with new boys, I tell you. I'd rather run away
to sea!" Wilfred's courage failing him once
more, he looked the picture of despair.</p>

<p>St. George seeing it, left his own part of the
trouble, and turned comforter:</p>

<p>"We're in for it, so all that is left is to face
the music."</p>

<p>"Only half-yearly vacations," threw in Wilfred.</p>

<p>St. George's face fell.</p>

<p>"And no boxes from home allowed."</p>

<p>St. George had no words of comfort.</p>

<p>"And no extra 'outs' ever given for good
behavior. If there were, I'd set up for a saint,"
added the victim savagely.</p>

<p>St. George was still silent.</p>

<p>"And all letters must pass through preceptor's
hands. Oh! I've seen the bill," said
Wilfred in the depths, "besides hearing father
and mother read it a good half dozen times.
It's just as bad as it can be&mdash;a regular old hole
of a prison, is Doctor Gowan's Select School
for Boys," throwing into his voice as much
animosity as he was capable of.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>St. George indulged in one or two uneasy
turns about the room&mdash;his workshop, made out
of a part of the generous garret that crowned
the old house.</p>

<p>Was not this a terrible punishment indeed for
a boy's misdemeanor? Too terrible, it seemed to
him, and he felt a growing bitterness in his heart
toward the parents who could plan and carry it
out, and thus mar, not only the happiness of
their own son, but that of a large circle of boys
who were to lose a jolly companion.</p>

<p>But at last conscience spoke: "You are
wrong. You <i>know</i> that Wilfred has done
many things of late that have tried the patience
of his father, his mother, and his teachers. You
<i>know</i> that they have borne with his increasing
unfaithfulness&mdash;that they have labored with
the boy, hoping and praying for better things.
You <i>know</i> they take this course feeling it best
for him, and while it is hard for him and for
you, it must be borne, realizing it to be the
result of the boy's own course. You <i>know</i> all
this, now give the case the justice in your own
mind that is its due."</p>

<p>St. George turned around and frankly put
out his hand.</p>

<p>"It's right you go," he said quite simply,
"we'll all try to get along till vacation, old
boy."</p>

<p>Wilfred, finding no pity forthcoming, put
his hand within the brown palm, waiting for it.</p>

<p>"Keep the rest of the chums together," he
begged.</p>

<p>"I'll do my best."</p>

<p>"And remember, we're to go to the same
college."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"And chum it there."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"And I wish," Wilfred looked steadily into
the blue eyes gazing into his, "I hadn't done it&mdash;dallied
over those old skates&mdash;but minded
father."</p>

<p>St. George bit his lip, but yet he would <i>not</i>
preach.</p>

<p>"I'll give you my word it's the last time I'll
ever get caught that way."</p>

<p>The blue eyes leaped into sudden fire, and
Wilfred's hand was wrung hard.</p>

<p>"All <i>right</i>, old fellow."</p>

<h2>A GAME OF ENGLISH HISTORY.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="112" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">THEY sat around a small table, half a
dozen bright boys and girls. Questions
and answers flew back and forth, literally,
for were they not printed upon
slips of pasteboard which were handed
about with exceeding rapidity? Upon listening
carefully, it was discoverable that they were
playing a game of English history.</div>

<p>Mr. Dalton, the father of the boy who was
the host of the evening, stood behind his son's
chair looking on and smiling at their eagerness.
Presently he said, during a pause in the game;</p>

<p>"Well, boys, you do well; you certainly have
a number of interesting facts and dates fastened
in your memories, but it occurs to me to wonder
if you know anything more than the mere
fact. For instance, take this question which is
the first that comes to mind, 'What two remarkable
events in the reign of Charles the
Second?' and the answer, 'The Great Plague
and Fire in London.' Now what more do you
know of those events?"</p>

<p>Fred Dalton looked up quickly. "I know a
little about the Fire, but I do not know about
the Plague. I suppose that there was a sort
of epidemic raged in London at that time."</p>

<p>"And it must have raged extensively or it
would not have been called the Great Plague,
and have got into history," said Will Ely.</p>

<p>"You are both very good at supposing," said
Mr. Dalton, laughing, "but it is sometimes better
to <i>know</i> about a thing than to guess at it."</p>

<p>"I have read an account of the Plague," said
Fred Smith. "It raged several months, all one
summer, and one third of the people of the city
died. Great numbers fled from the city, and so
many died that they could not have any burial
service, but just buried them in a great pit in the
night. They built great bonfires in the streets
hoping that the fire and smoke would prevent
the spread of the disease, but heavy rains put
out the fires. It was a dreadful time!"</p>

<p>"Indeed it was," said Mr. Dalton; "the
accounts of it are harrowing. And now what
do you know of the Great Fire, Fred?"</p>

<p>"I know that it started in a baker's shop near
London Bridge, and that it burned over about
five sixths of the city. It burned three days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
and nights. It was in September, after a very
hot and dry summer, so that the houses built of
wood were in a well-seasoned state, and made
first-rate kindling wood. And then there was
a wind that fanned the fire and carried sparks
and cinders a long distance, so that new fires
kept breaking out in different parts of the city.
It is said that there were two hundred thousand
people who lost their homes, and that the streets
leading out of the city were barricaded with
broken-down wagons which the people flying
from the fire had overloaded with their goods."</p>


<p>"It was a terrible calamity," said Mr. Dalton;
"but like many another it proved a blessing,
for the new London was much better built."</p>

<p>"Was the fire set by bad men, or was it an
accident?" asked one of the boys.</p>

<p>"Without doubt it was set accidentally,
though many people thought otherwise. A
monument was erected near the place where
the fire started in memory of those who lost
their lives in that terrible time, and there was
an inscription upon the monument charging the
Papists with the crime, but this unjust accusation
was afterwards removed by the order of
the public authorities. But I will not hinder
your game any longer."</p>

<p>"We like this sort of hindering," said one of
the boys. "It makes it more interesting."</p>

<p>Mr. Dalton soon returned to say, "Boys, there
is a 'Great Fire' in the kitchen, and a pan of
corn waiting to be popped, and a Bridget there
who does not think boys a 'Great Plague.'"</p>

<p>In less than half a minute there were no boys
sitting around that table!</p>

<h2>NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>I HAVE seldom known a boy who was
not interested in the history of Napoleon.
To me his story is like a novel,
and no character ever charmed me more
than that of his wife, the Empress Josephine.
But I cannot find it in my heart
to admire a man who so ruthlessly shed
human blood. He stopped at nothing for
his own personal advancement. Never
has any conqueror fought more battles
perhaps than he.</div>

<div class="caption">ON ST. HELENA.</div>
</div>


<p>All Europe seemed draped in the
weeds of mourning during the years of
his power and greatness. I have often
thought his reflections must have been
sad indeed, when, during the last five
years of his life, he was a weary exile on
the little gum-tree island of St. Helena,
with only a few friends around him, and
subjected to great unkindness from the
governor of the island.</p>

<p>St. Helena is an island in the South
Atlantic Ocean, belonging to the British.
It acquired celebrity from being the place of
Napoleon's banishment. From the ocean it has
the appearance of a lofty pyramidal mass of a
dark-gray color, rising abruptly from out its
depths.</p>

<p>But on approaching, a number of openings are
discovered, forming the mouths of narrow valleys
or ravines, leading gradually up to a central
plateau. On these, at all openings where
a landing might be effected, military works
have been erected for the purpose of making
it secure.</p>

<p>What a contrast does his life there present,
to the time when great continents trembled
before the power of his triumphant armies.</p>

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte was born in Corsica, 1769,
and died at St. Helena, 1821, where he was buried
beneath a weeping willow, for nineteen years,
when France demanded his remains, and gave
such a funeral as few perhaps have ever witnessed.</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>FOR the lovely midsummer evenings I should
propose two games, one for July and one
for August. The July one is</div>

<h3>
THE CARNIVAL OF THE BOATS.<br />
</h3>

<p>If any of the Pansies live near a river or lake,
and are accustomed to row over the clear, shining
surface, they can enter heartily into this
most delightful of games. I should first seriously
recommend that father or big brother
John be invited to take charge of the boat, or
if there are not enough big brothers to go
around so that every boat can be under trusty
guidance, there always is a big cousin or an
uncle, or perchance a paid boatman who is competent
to assume such a responsibility.</p>

<p>This being all arranged, the fun of trimming
the small craft begins. Let each boatload keep
all matters secret, so that the grand surprises
that come out when the Carnival takes place,
may form one of the pleasantest features of the
occasion.</p>

<p>Get Chinese lanterns, fasten a pole at either
end of row-boat, low enough so that the boats
can pass safely under bridges if necessary. Two
poles at either end are pretty when decorated
with gay lanterns. Pass strings from one pole
to another, and across from bow to stern. Hang
on these bright bits of tinsel, silver, or any
other trifle that will sparkle in the moonlight.
Put tinsel or silver bands around top of oars
above the hands&mdash;and a band around the
rower's arms, and around caps. Let the girls
wear white, with bright colors, and fancy hats
or jaunty caps, carrying garlands.</p>

<p>When all is ready, the forward boat must
carry one who rings a bell as the signal to start,
also if possible some boys who can play on
flutes or horns. There should be sweet voices
on all the boats that can sing by a preconcerted
plan, something in unison. As the boat sweeps
around curves, and dips into bays, and shallows,
one could never witness a prettier sight than
the carnival presents. It is a regular game of
"Follow my Leader" on the water. There
must be complete obedience to the one who is
leading, great good-nature, and a positive determination
on the part of every child who enters
into the sport to try his or her best to make all
the others enjoy it.</p>

<p>After sailing around and around, singing and
playing until tired, the Carnival ends with tying
the boats fast, and "following the Leader" over
the fields home, dropping the flowers at the
doors of those who were not able to take part
in the sport.</p>

<p>May you enjoy this Carnival of the Boats,
dear Pansies, making it a bright spot in the
lives of many, and a memory to gladden the
heart.</p>

<h2>NAMES OF THE MONTHS.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>JANUARY was so called from Janus, an
old Italian king, and comes from a Latin
word Januarius. February comes from februe,
meaning to purify, because in that month the
Romans offered sacrifices for purifying the people.
March comes from Mars, the God of War.
April comes from the word Aprilus, which
means opening, because then the world buds
and blossoms forth. May, from Majores, so
called by Romulus, in respect to the Senators.
June, from the Latin, Junius, or the younger
sort of the people. July, from Julius Cæsar.
August, called from Augustus. September,
from the Latin, septem, meaning seven, being
the seventh month from March. October, from
Latin, octo, eight; November, from novem,
nine, the ninth month from March. December,
from the Latin, decem, ten, being the tenth
month from March, which was formerly the
manner of beginning the year.</div>

<h2>THE DOG AND CHILD.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>MR. ELIHU BURRITT gives in his book
called "A Walk from London to Land's
End and Back," the touching illustration of the
affection of a dog in Truro: "I was sitting at
the breakfast table of a friend, who was a druggist,
when he was called into the shop by a
neighbor, who had come for medical aid in a
very remarkable and affecting case.</div>

<p>"He described it briefly and simply, but it
would fill a volume of beautiful meaning.</p>

<p>"His family dog had made the acquaintance of
a neighbor's child on the other side of the street.</p>

<p>"While lying on the door-stone, he had
noticed this little thing sometimes at the chamber
window, and sometimes on the pavement,
in a little carriage.</p>

<p>"During one of his walks on that side of the
street, he met the baby, and looked over the
rim of the carriage, as a loving dog can look,
straight into a pair of baby eyes, and said,
'Good morning!' as well as he could.</p>

<p>"Little by little, day by day and week by
week, this companionship went on growing with
the growth and strengthening with the strength
of the little one. The dog, doubtless because
his master had no young child of his own, came
at last to transfer frequently his watch and ward
to the door-stone on the other side of the street,
and to follow as a guard of honor to the baby's
carriage on its daily airings. He gave himself
up to all the peltings, and little rude rompings,
and rough and tumblings of those baby hands.</p>

<p>"One day, as the dog lay in watch by the
door-stone, the child, peeping out of the window
above, lost its balance, and fell on the stone
pavement below. It was taken up quite dead!
The red drops of the young life had bespattered
the feet and face of the dog as he sprang to the
rescue. His heart died out within him in one
long, whining howl of grief. From that moment
he refused to eat. He refused to be comforted
by his master's voice and by his master's
home. Day by day and night by night he lay
upon the spot where the child fell.</p>

<p>"This was the neighbor's errand. He told it
in a few simple words. He had come to my
friend, the druggist, for a prescription for his
dog&mdash;something to bring back his appetite."</p>

<h2>HOW SOME MISSIONARIES TRAVEL.</h2>

<div class='center'>(<i>Extract from a letter written by Pauline Root, M. D.,
Medical missionary in Madura, India.</i>)</div>

<div class='unindent'>
<span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>:<br />
</div>

<p>Have you any sort of an idea what it is to
travel in a bullock bandy? The wagon itself I
suppose to be somewhat like what the Western
emigrants used, in days gone by. It is supposed
to be very comfortable, and sometimes three or
four persons occupy one; but how they do it, is
a mystery to me, for my two trips have been by
myself, and I certainly had no room to spare.</p>

<p>My first experience was in going to visit a
sick missionary thirty-eight miles away. It was
during the rainy season. I took with me a servant,
who spoke English, and if it had not been
for that, I don't know what I should have done.</p>

<p>Bullocks were supposed to be posted along
the road, but at the first changing place, none
could be hired. We went on, four miles, and
there succeeded in getting a pair so frisky that
I seemed at times in danger of losing my life.
How they <i>did</i> behave! One was especially unwilling
to be tied. More than once the bandy
bumped down with me, and one bullock ran
away up the road, leaving the other beside himself
with fear. However, we got started at last,
but I was afraid of something happening all the
time we had those animals.</p>

<p>The river, which in the dry season is simply a
great bed of sand, in the rainy season is sometimes
so high that bandys cannot cross, except
on rafts, and sometimes not at all, because of
the very swift current.</p>

<p>On our return trip the river was nearly its
full width, and was rushing along with a tremendous
sweep. It was not very deep, however,
and I decided not to wait the river's pleasure,
but to risk crossing it. It took twenty-one men
to get us across that river! Pudchi, my servant,
piled all my boxes on the board, which, in a
bandy, is the bed, and he and I perched ourselves
on them, balancing as best we could.
One man went ahead to sound the river, two
guided the bullocks' heads, two drove, eight
took the wheels, five pushed, and the others
steadied us; for more than once it seemed as if
the current would sweep us over. However,
after the first scare, I felt safe, and rather enjoyed
my ride. Landed on the other side of
the river, the water was emptied out of the
bandy, and we went on, for hours, through the
palm-tree forests and the banyan-lined avenues.
The moonlight was almost dazzling, and the
banyan and palm-trees glittered like silver.</p>

<p>Would you like to know the cost of getting
over that river? It cost two cents a man! The
roads were so muddy that we had occasionally
to get help, to push the bandy along. Once, in
getting out of a hole, the wheel was thrown
over the bank of a tauk; the driver did not dare
try going on, with me inside, so I crawled out
over the wheel! We were thirteen hours in
making the thirty-eight miles. Part of the time
I arranged my pillows and tried to be comfortable;
but what comfort can you take when, even
by bracing yourself, you cannot keep quiet for a
moment?</p>

<p>After part of the thirteen hours were spent,
I found I was indulging in a headache. I did
my head up in a wet towel, and tried to apply
"Mentholine" to my forehead; but the jolting
of the bandy caused me, when aiming at one
temple, to thrust the instrument into the opposite
eye. After some experiments I thought it
might be safer to make a dive for an eye in the
first place, and see where the cone would land,
but concluded not to try it.</p>

<h2>MY HAND IN HIS.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>A LITTLE boy who came before the pastor
to be received into the church, was asked
how he expected to lead a Christian life, and he
sweetly replied, "I will put my hand in Jesus'
hand, and I know He will lead me right." This
is just the thing, my little ones, for us <i>all</i> to do,
and if we did it, we should not so often stumble
and fall. We are so apt to try to walk <i>alone!</i>
But this we cannot do, in this dark world.</div>

<p>I called to see a dear friend lately, and she
repeated to me a lovely poem in which these two
lines occurred:</p>

<div class='poem'>
I'd rather walk with Him in the dark<br />
Than to walk alone in the light.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>And I assure you the former is far safer for us
than the latter. He never lets us fall, if we
hold His hand!</div>

<h2>"WHAT SHE COULD."</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="55" height="112" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">ALICE MERWYN felt as though she had
stepped into a new world that Monday
morning when she began her summer's
work at Lime Rock. An entire stranger
in the neighborhood, expected to teach
and manage twenty restless and judging from
appearances hitherto unmanageable children,
and she only seventeen, she was nearly overwhelmed.</div>

<p>And yet Alice Merwyn was not easily discouraged;
she had a certain self-poise which
some people called self-conceit, others named
self-confidence, but which, name it as you will,
grew out of a knowledge of her powers coupled
with a strong faith in her Leader.</p>

<p>As the days went by she found she had no
easy task. There were two or three disorderly
spirits in the school who set at defiance all
rules. She was surprised at the utter ignorance
which some of her pupils showed of the Bible
and religious truth.</p>

<p>She had resolved to open school with devotional
exercises, as the trustee had assured her
there would be no objection to such a course.
None of the children brought their Bibles the
first day, but in compliance with her request
there was quite a show of Bibles the next morning.
One or two said they had none, and these
were allowed to "look over" with those who
were willing to share their books with them.
Alice gave out the chapter which she had
selected for their reading, and one little girl
looked up in surprise to see them all finding the
place, and asked with a puzzled expression:</p>

<p>"Is it alike in all the books?" And then she
as well as others had to be shown how to find
the chapter. And Alice explained that the
Bible was the word of God, and the books they
had brought were all copies of the words which
God had given to his people. When she asked
how many knew the Lord's Prayer, only three
raised their hands. And as for the Ten Commandments,
the most of the children had never
heard of them. And Alice thought, "surely
here is work for some one."</p>

<p>During that week she tried to teach them the
Lord's Prayer, but as they made slow progress
in the few moments which she felt that she had
a right to use in that way, she thought of a
plan.</p>

<p>"How many of you would like to come here
Sunday afternoon and be taught about God and
the Bible?"</p>

<p>Almost every hand went up, and the appointment
was made and kept, too.</p>

<p>And every Sunday afternoon all through the
summer Alice Merwyn spent an hour in the
dingy little country schoolhouse surrounded by
a group of children who soon came to hang
upon her words as well as upon her chair.</p>

<p>"Dear me! I should think you had enough
of those children through the week without
going there these hot Sunday afternoons!" said
May Andrus, the daughter of the lady with
whom Alice boarded.</p>

<p>"Well, it seems that they do not have enough
of me!" replied Alice, laughing a little.</p>

<p>"But they have no right to your Sundays!"
said May.</p>

<p>"I differ with you; I think they have the
best right."</p>

<p>"I do not understand; I supposed you were
hired to teach five days in the week, only," replied
May.</p>

<p>"True, Mr. Pratt engaged me for the school
week, but I have another Master, May. And
he seems to be saying to me 'do this thing.'
The children need me, I think, and that is why
I said they have a right to a part of my Sundays."</p>

<p>"O, you are too good to be comfortable! Now
if you would give up the scheme and sit in the
hammock this afternoon and read, how we
would enjoy ourselves!"</p>

<p>"I must not disappoint the children!" and
Alice went down the dusty road wishing that
May was interested in the matter enough to go
with her.</p>

<p>After the lesson of that afternoon they lingered
a little in familiar talk. Fred Pratt had
been the most unruly of all her pupils, but of
late he had changed greatly, and his example
was having a marked effect upon the good order
of the school. That afternoon Alice said:</p>

<p>"I wonder how many of us hope we are
Christians? or how many are trying to be
Christians?"</p>

<p>There was a little hesitation, a looking shyly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
at each other, then three hands went up. And
Alice's heart gave a great bound of thanksgiving.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" she asked, and
Fred spoke first:</p>

<p>"For one thing I think I am not as saucy to
you as I used to be, and I know I could not help
it, if Jesus did not hold me back from getting
mad. O, Miss Merwyn! I have learned a great
deal from you. I never knew anything about
the Bible before you came! I've read it some,
but it never seemed a bit interesting, but now I
love it, and I just want to tell people how nice
it is. I don't believe everybody knows about
it!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 588px;">
<img src="images/illus076.jpg" width="588" height="493" alt="woman walking by water" />
<div class="caption">"ALICE WENT DOWN THE DUSTY ROAD."</div>
</div>

<p>"I am afraid they do not," said Alice, "and,
Fred, it is a good thing to want to tell others the
good news and perhaps the Lord will want you
to do that when you are older. Who knows?"</p>

<p>Then little Annie Andrus spoke.</p>

<p>"I think, teacher, that I am a better girl than
I was, because I do not get so vexed at sister
May when she pulls my curls mornings; I used
to scream sometimes, and now I just set my
teeth hard and ask Jesus to help me to keep
back the yell! and I haven't quarrelled with
Kittie in a week."</p>

<p>Fannie Brown was older than Annie, indeed
she was the oldest scholar in school, and as
Alice turned towards her, she said softly,</p>

<p>"I am so happy, and the little hymns which
you have taught us keep bubbling over all the
time. Everything goes right, and I love the
Saviour, and am trying all the time to do what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
He would like to have me do. I don't know as
it is being a Christian, but I want to be one, if I
am not."</p>

<p>"What makes you so queer to-night?" asked
May that evening.</p>

<p>"Queer, am I?" returned Alice.</p>

<p>"Yes, queer and quiet. Your face shines as
if you had heard some wonderful news or
something."</p>

<p>"I have!" said Alice. "I have heard of
that which angels smile over." And then she
told May the story of the afternoon, and May
replied, more soberly than her wont, "I declare,
Alice Merwyn, if there is anything in religion
that will subdue such a boy as Fred Pratt has
been I shall believe in it! Why, he has been the
terror of the neighborhood! And dear little
Annie! I shall never twitch her hair again."</p>

<p>May put up her frizzes silently with a quiet
look on her face, and at length she turned to
Alice and said:</p>

<p>"I believe I'll go to Sunday-school with you
after this. I can't have my little sister getting
ahead of me."</p>

<p>Do you think Alice Merwyn will ever regret
the effort she made to help the children in that
out-of-the-way neighborhood to a knowledge of
the truths of the Bible?</p>

<h2>THE ALABASTER BOX.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>MY dear little friends, I suppose many of
you have read the sweet story in the
Bible, about Mary who broke for her Lord and
Master the precious box of Alabaster. It was
a very costly and rare perfume. I want to tell
you, that although Christ is no longer with us
here on earth, yet we can still break for him our
Alabaster boxes. Do you ask me how? Well,
He says that when we serve His dear children,
we serve Him, just as much as though He were
present with us. And I think every day, perhaps
every hour, we can give to Him one of our
Alabaster boxes. I do not mean the very ointment
that Mary had, but we can speak kind and
helpful words, we can encourage the downtrodden,
we can carry flowers to the sick, make our
homes sunny and cheerful, lend books to the
poor, comfort our pastor, and do, oh! so many
<i>little</i> things to make others rejoice!</div>

<h2>WORK FINISHED EARLY.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i2.jpg" width="70" height="117" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">I HAVE lately been reading a sketch
of one who finished her work early and
went to rest. To those left behind still
toiling in the field it seemed that her
work was broken off and left unfinished,
but He who called her to the service, and afterwards
called her home, knew when to say "it is
finished"; nothing can be half-done that is done
according to His command.</div>

<p>Of "Nina's" childhood we are told of her
"golden hair, fair cheek and graceful form; of
her quick, laughing eye, of her sensitive face
reflecting every changing thought&mdash;her ready
answers to all Sabbath-school questions, and her
sunshiny presence at school and at home."</p>

<p>"Her scholarship was bright, quick and accurate.</p>

<p>"In social life few shone more brilliantly, or
were more admired and sought after.</p>

<p>"Her beauty was of a rare and noticeable
type, her conversational powers were fascinating,
and she early developed rare powers of mind."</p>

<p>Her beauty, intelligence and social powers
were early consecrated to the Master's service.
We are told that "when a little child, from
eight to twelve years old, she and some of her
companions formed a praying circle and had a
little room in one of their homes which they
called the house of prayer. They met often in
this room which they delighted to decorate after
their childish fashion."</p>

<p>I can imagine the little girls bringing from
the old-fashioned gardens bunches of flowers,
snowballs, peonies, honeysuckles and sweet-smelling
pinks and roses, or bringing from the
woods evergreens and trailing vines to garland
this bower where they met to hold sweet childish
communion with their Saviour.</p>

<p>"Another favorite occupation was teaching
some poor children whom she and her companions
gathered for lessons in sewing and reading."</p>

<p>I cannot tell you all the sweet story of this
beautiful life, only a bit here and there. When
she was eleven years old she was asked by her
pastor how long she had loved Jesus, and she
replied, "Oh! a great many years."</p>

<p>There was nothing unchildlike in her ways.
She is said to have been a peculiarly bright,
active and happy child, growing to womanhood
the delight of her home and tenderly shielded
from rude contact with the world. But this
noble woman, "so eminently fitted for usefulness
in circles of refinement," was called to
spend her life among the degraded Indians of
the Northwest. There were those who thought
it a great wrong that such a beautiful and accomplished
girl upon whose education so much pains
and money had been expended, should be given
to the Missionary work among the coarse, ignorant
Indians. They thought that some one less
fit for the adornment of social life could do the
work as well. But both she and her parents
felt that the best was not too precious to be
given to the Lord to be used wherever he
directed. And this is a thought that I would
like you to stop over. Let us give our best of
everything to the Lord. And when we have
given it let us be willing that He should do with
it as he sees fit. Sometimes we think we are
ready to give our best, but we would like to
dictate as to where or how it shall be used. Let
us see to it that it is a complete surrender.</p>

<p>If you will look upon the map and trace the
course of the Missouri River you will come to
a place marked Fort Sully, near the centre of
Dakota. To this far-away region as the wife of
an Indian Missionary, who was himself the son
of a pioneer in Indian Missions, Nina Foster
went to make her home in a log cabin, shutting
away from the busy world her beauty and her
talents, giving her young life to the cause of
Indian Missions. She gave herself to the work
joyfully. We are told that her "sense of humor
and keen wit lightened many a load for herself
and others; the more forlorn and hopeless the
situation, the more elastic her spirits." She
always made the best of everything. Even
when the road was so rough and the riding so
insecure that she had to be strapped in to keep
from falling out of the wagon she made merry
over the circumstance instead of detailing it as
a hardship. For five years she labored among
the Dakota Indian women, who speak of her as
the "beautiful woman who spoke so well."
Then God called her to himself.</p>

<p>Was this life, with its beauty and its talents,
wasted? We cannot think so; we know not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
why God called her to bury herself for a few
years in that remote region, and then, just when
the work seemed opening before her, why he
should call her away. Perhaps he wanted to
show to a doubting world that the cause of
Missions was so important that for its advancement
he would use the very one whom the world
looked upon as too good for the work. Perhaps
he wanted to prove to some doubter the power
of that love that would draw such an one as
Nina Foster Riggs away from the admiring and
flattering circle in which she moved and lead
her to give herself to a life of self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>It may be that he wanted to put a bright gem
in the midst of the darkness of ignorance and
heathenism, that its shining might "enlighten,
captivate, lead forth and refine."</p>

<p>For us, we may learn that our best, our very
best, even <i>ourselves</i>, is the gift we are called
upon to give. Shall we consecrate whatever
we have, whatever we are, to the service of our
Lord&mdash;<i>now?</i></p>

<h2>JENNIE'S VICTORY.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>"JENNIE," said her sister Ella, "you are
fond of talking about gaining victories;
but I think if you would only conquer that bad
temper, it would be a glorious victory."</div>

<p>But this made Jennie angry; and she went
away to nurse her anger.</p>

<p>The first book she took up happened to be a
Bible; it opened of itself to the place: "A soft
answer turneth away wrath."</p>

<p>Meantime, would you like to know what was
the trouble? On their way home from school,
Jennie and her friend Albert quarrelled. Albert
said Jennie's friend Lila Johnson missed a
word, and Jennie said she didn't; and they disputed
until both were angry.</p>

<p>As Jennie read the Bible verse, she could not
help thinking what if she had answered Albert
that perhaps she was mistaken; then she was
sure all would have been right between them;
however, she was too angry to listen to the soft
voice which was whispering this in her ear; she
closed the book, and went down stairs.</p>

<p>Cousin Harold was in the sitting-room with
Ella; when he caught sight of Jennie's red face
and tearful eyes he began to question. Harold's
advice was to ask Albert's pardon; and he
volunteered to go with her to Albert's house.</p>

<p>Jennie was almost sure to do as cousin Harold
said, and in a short time they were walking
down street together.</p>

<p>Only a block from her own house she met
Albert, and stopping, said hurriedly: "Albert,
I'm coming to tell you that I'm sorry."</p>

<p>Said Albert, "So am I."</p>

<p>"There!" said cousin Harold, "I fancy you
have gained quite a victory. What a fine thing
it would be, if you were always a brave general,
and gained victories for the right."</p>

<p>After that, she went to a store with Harold,
and waited while he did some errands. While
they were there, Albert came skipping back to
ask Jennie to go home with him to tea; that
mamma said so, and she had a real nice tea for
him, "because it's my birthday, you know."</p>

<p>Cousin Harold gave permission, and away
went the happy children who were enemies such
a short time before, but had been made friends
by a few "soft words."</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>SEE here, my Blossoms, keep your thoughts
carefully fixed on what I am going to tell
you, so that you will understand, and not have
to ask me any questions. Sometimes, you know,
when mamma is talking to you, you only half
listen, and pretty soon you say: "O, mamma,
what did you say? I didn't quite understand."
You mean, "I was thinking about something
else."</div>

<p>Now! Attention! If you, my Blossom, have
received, with your badge, a letter signed
"Pansy" in which I have answered your questions,
and given you greeting, you of course
will not expect me to reply to your letter again
in <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>. Because people do not receive
two replies to one letter, now do they? But if,
on the contrary, you have received through my
secretary, your badge, and a line stating that
your letter will be answered in <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>, in
due time, why, then look out for it; though
when its turn will come is more than I can tell
you; the truth is, there are at least a <i>thousand</i>
letters now awaiting answers! If some of you
get gray before I can reach you with a letter,
you will not blame me, will you? Because,
really and truly, I am doing my <i>very</i> best; and
I answer privately all the letters I possibly can,
so that you will not have to wait so long.</p>

<p>Meantime, I expect each of you to show how
patient and unselfish a Pansy Blossom can be in
this matter, as well as in larger ones.</p>

<p>I wish you a very pleasant Fourth of July. I
hope it will be "independence day" to you;
that you will each prove yourselves free from
every chain which Satan can think of to try to
throw around you on that day.</p>

<p>If you feel like writing to tell me how you
spent the day, and what one thing you did in it
to give some one a happy time, whom you
thought might else be forgotten, I shall be very
glad to hear the stories. Remember to send
your letters to Chautauqua, Chautauqua Co.,
N. Y., and my secretary who is there, will see
that I receive them promptly.</p>

<p>And now, good-by once more, until August.</p>

<p><i>Violet</i> from Maine. So violets can blossom
in your State in the midst of a snowstorm! I
am glad; and I hope it is a very sweet flower.
Still I see the weeds trouble you. The one you
mention, grows very fast, unless constantly
watched. Don't let it hurt the perfume of your
blossom.</p>

<p><i>Clintie</i> from Massachusetts. Dear little boy,
we welcome you to our garden. Fretful words
are troublesome weeds; and it is sometimes a
great temptation to use them to those who are
<i>in</i> our family, but not <i>of</i> it. I am glad you are
pledged to watch their growth. Those who
are all the time away from their homes and
friends, need our help in every possible way.</p>

<p><i>Emily</i> from Connecticut. Dear! dear! these
<i>tongues</i>. What shall we do with them! And
yet, what would we do without them? It is so
easy to think of some bright little word to say
in return, at just the moment when we ought to
keep quiet. I read of a boy who kept a clothes
pin in his pocket, ready to clap on his tongue
when he was tempted to speak words which he
ought not. But I think there are better checks
than clothes pins. Don't you?</p>

<p><i>Lulu</i> from New York. Another Blossom
from the "Snow!" You are welcome. "Slang"
is a word which covers a very disagreeable habit
indeed. It astonishes me to see how many people
who think themselves cultivated, indulge in
it. I have noticed that it is sometimes connected
with the other weed of which you speak.
By all means get rid of them both, keeping the
"Whisper Motto" in mind.</p>

<p><i>Bertha</i> and <i>Stella</i> from Iowa. It is natural
enough to like to play rather than to work. I
presume men and women who work hard would
often rather play. The great difference between
people is, that some of them do what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
would rather not, because it is duty; and some
of them do what they would rather, because
they <i>want</i> to. I am glad to think of Bertha as
belonging to the first class; for the others are
rather worthless people. As for the dear little
Blossom who describes herself in this way:</p>

<div class='poem'>
There was a little girl, and she had a little curl,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Right in the middle of her forehead;</span><br />
And when she was good, she was very, <i>very</i> good,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when she was bad, she was <i>horrid</i>,</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>truth compels me to say that she has a great
many brothers and sisters! But Stella is not
to belong to their family any more.</div>

<p><i>Mabel</i> from New York. I once had a kitchen
girl who was a source of great amusement to
my family because she fretted about everything.
One morning I said to her: "Rebecca, we are
going to have a rainy day, I fear."</p>

<p>"Of course we are," she answered; "as sure
as I have a large wash, and need sunshine
especially <i>much</i>, it is sure to rain." An hour
afterwards the sun was shining brightly. As I
went through the wash-room I said to Rebecca,
"It didn't rain after all, did it? See what beautiful
air for drying clothes."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," she said, "sun hot enough to bake
me just as I am ready to hang out clothes; that
is always the way."</p>

<p>The fact was, poor Rebecca in her younger
days had contracted such a habit of fretting,
that she really seemed unable to find a bright
side to anything. I am glad you are pledged
against such an enemy.</p>

<p><i>Agnes</i> from Illinois. I think <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> is
a very nice present. I am glad you agree with
me. I agree with you that forgetful people are
very troublesome, and sometimes in danger.
There was once a little girl who forgot to turn
out the gas in her room, but blew it out instead,
as though it was a candle, and lost her life in
consequence. We welcome you to the P. S.</p>

<p><i>Mertie</i> from Maine. "Foolish" questions are
really very troublesome. The other day I sent a
boy to the cellar for a certain jar. "Which jar?"
he asked. "I told you there was but one," I
said. "Oh, where is it?" "In the cellar, as I
told you." "Which cellar?" said this foolish
boy; and yet he knew as well as I did, that
there was but one cellar in the house.</p>

<p>This same boy once lost his breakfast because
he did not get up when he was called. I congratulate
your mother because of your pledge.</p>

<p><i>Medie</i> from Michigan. Carelessness is a dangerous
enemy. A careless little girl set a bottle
on a chair within reach of her baby sister, and
now poor baby is blind! It only took a moment
to put the bottle in the right or wrong place.
So sometimes the carelessness of one minute
causes a life time of sorrow. Welcome to our
garden. I am glad you mean to work to extend
the usefulness of <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>.</p>

<p><i>Hattie</i> from Illinois. Did you ever read the
story of the great man who had a little dog
named Diamond? I always admired his patience.
If you do not know the story, suppose you look
it up. Will you kiss Marion for me?</p>

<p>Your age? Let me think; I am not good at
"guessing." Suppose I say twelve? Is that it?
When you get the missionary society in good
working order, send us a report of its doings.</p>

<p><i>Ella</i> from Pennsylvania. It seems to be a
very hard lesson for my Blossoms to learn&mdash;that
of prompt obedience. It is well for the
world that so many are working hard at it. As
for doors, I have heard them slam when I did
not think the wind was to blame. Hands can
do wrong as well as feet and tongues. The
truth is, all our body-servants need watching.</p>

<p><i>Bessie</i> from Iowa. I shall have to tell you a
story about Neddie. His brother Rob who
loved him dearly, was tempted to tease him,
occasionally, "just for fun!" One day he said
in a frightened tone: "O Neddy! What is that
great big bug on the back of your neck?" Poor
Neddy was afraid of all kinds of bugs. He
gave a quick little jump from the piazza where
he stood, fell over backward, hit his head against
a stone pillar, and never spoke again! Poor Rob!
Doesn't your heart ache for him?</p>

<p>I once heard a good man say that "by-words"
were side doors to profanity. What do you
think?</p>

<p><i>H. E.</i> from Kentucky. You have left me to
guess your name. Well, I "guess" that it is
Harrison Eleazar. Am I right? Never mind,
you know your own name; see that you do
credit to it. I like your pledge. It is a very
common fault to speak ill of persons. I wish
all the Pansies would take a resolution against
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jennison and Milton</i> from Virginia. It gives
me pleasure, my boys, to know that you enjoy
your badges, and that they help you. I earnestly
hope to hear that Warren and Jennison
are able to wear theirs to all appropriate places;
yet I confess I wouldn't like to think of them
as being worn by boys who had not tried hard
to do them honor. I expect to hear good news
from you <i>all</i>, next time.</p>

<p><i>Albert</i> from California. Obeying "after the
third or fourth time," is sometimes obeying too
late. It does me good to know that one more
boy is resolved to cultivate the habit of prompt
obedience. I know you will make a better man
because of this. There was once a boy who
had a sharp lesson on promptness. His uncle
called two boys, Warren and Robert, to come to
the yard at once; Warren went on the instant,
but Robert waited to finish the page in the
story he was reading. When he finally reached
the yard, he found Warren seated on a pony's
back, and he shouted out that the pony was his.
"Yes," said his uncle, "I intended the pony for
both of you; but since Robert did not come I
concluded he did not want any pony; and gave
it to Warren."</p>

<p>I think that was pretty hard. Don't you?
But the truth was, Robert had such a habit of
waiting awhile, after being called, that I suppose
his uncle thought he needed a severe lesson.</p>

<p><i>Walter and Harry</i> from Rhode Island. Two
brothers, one of whom is to learn "patience,"
and the other means to "stop whining." Good
resolves, both of them. A whining face is
never a pleasant one; and as for patience, it is
needed all the time to help us through this
world.</p>

<p><i>Minnie</i> from Kansas. I don't like to be
teased; do you? I'm sure I hear you say, "No,
ma'am." Then, according to the Golden Rule,
you and I ought not to tease other people; and
I am glad you have resolved not to do so. As
to the finger-nails, of course they do not like to
be bitten. Only three Pansy Blossoms in your
city? Why, that is too bad! Can't you plant
some more?</p>

<p><i>Florence</i> from Missouri. Give my love to my
namesake, the dolly; though I am afraid she
will care nothing about it. After all, I don't
know how many cats you have, though you
undertook to tell me. Can you guess why I do
not know? Please try.</p>

<p><i>Minnie</i> from Connecticut. Your letter was
not at all "silly," my little friend, but we only
publish in <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> those letters that give
interesting stories about people or animals, or
places; something which will interest all. You
know one doesn't like to publish one's <i>personal</i>
letters for others to read. I hope you will have
your wish and "change into a very good girl."
In fact, I know you will, if you wish it enough
to keep daily trying, and trust in the great
Helper.</p>

<p><i>Maggie</i> from Kentucky. How glad I am that
we have another Blossom who has resolved to
guard her lips from the use of slang words!
Think of a flower speaking in any but sweet
and refined language! Who would want to
make bouquets of flowers whose breaths were
impure?</p>

<p><i>Alma</i> from Kentucky. You have taken a very
important pledge. There is hardly another so
important. I hope every Pansy in our garden
will be a brave earnest worker for temperance;
by which I mean the sort of total abstinence
which determines to "touch not, taste not, handle
not."</p>

<p><i>Mollie</i> from Kentucky. How much I should
like to hear that your pledge had helped you to
be present in Sabbath-school each Sabbath this
year! Wouldn't that be pleasant? But there
are some absences over which we have no control,
are there not? Well, suppose we put it,
each Sabbath that you are not detained by sickness,
or by some cause which you could not
help? Then let us hear at the close of the year,
what success you have had.</p>

<p><i>Lizzie</i> from Illinois. It is pleasant to hear of
an entire class joining the P. S. You can be
helpful to one another. "In a minute" is a very
bad sprite, who gets many people into trouble;
have nothing to do with him. I think many
persons who really intend to do the right thing,
are caught by Satan, in this way; instead of
trying to get them to decide against it, which
he knows they wouldn't do, he coaxes them to
put the duty off until they forget all about it.
I trust he will not get the advantage of you.</p>

<p><i>Lara</i> from Illinois. So the meek little pansy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
on its satin bed has done its duty and helped
you? I am glad. Do you know, I think "little
things" are harder to bear than big ones? Someway,
we make up our minds to be patient and
brave over real troubles, but little pin pricks
are likely to find us off our guard; so a pledge
against just these "little foxes" is very important.</p>

<p><i>Elma</i> from Dakota Territory. Dear little
Blossom, what a sweet letter you wrote me with
your own hand! I think your lips must be very
sweet when they have a smile on them; but
"grumbles" are almost sure to dress themselves
in ugly pouts. I would have nothing to do with
them.</p>

<p><i>Olive</i> and <i>Hattie</i> from Michigan. A "black"
Pansy? No I do not think "thoughtlessness"
is black. It is my opinion it is a dull gray-brown;
such as my children in Sabbath school
call dirt-color. Let us remember that it is a
weed, not a pansy, but has crept in among
some of our Blossoms unawares, and is to be
rooted out. May you succeed in keeping your
corner free from its power. Hattie dear, I am
sorry for your long waiting. The first letter
must have gone astray. What good news you
both gave me! May you shine so brightly in
your home, that "baby May" will early follow
your example.</p>

<p><i>Rose</i> from &mdash;&mdash;. You forgot the State, little
Rose, so I have to guess at the place where you
bloom. I think it is better to wear the badges
only on special occasions, and so to keep them
fresh and neat-looking, a long time. However,
they can be renewed at ten cents each, whenever
the owners think they ought to have new
ones.</p>

<p><i>Gertie</i> from Massachusetts. You are right,
little girl. All over the world, young people
seem to be troubled with very much the same
weeds. Satan must depend a great deal on
these "quick tempers," he has so many of them
at work for him. I rejoice over every boy or
girl who resolves to break from his power. How
glad I am that <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> helps you! That is
sweet praise. I am also glad that you send it
on, to help others, when you are through with it.</p>

<p><i>Julia</i> from Connecticut. Whispering tongues
make a great deal of trouble. Watch yours
with care. Dear Julia, one who truly wants
to be a Christian has to bring her <i>will</i> into
the matter. Do you know what I mean? As
soon as we honestly determine that, whether
it is easy or hard, whether we are happy in it
or unhappy, we will from this moment give
ourselves to the Lord Jesus to obey Him in all
things, He comes, and takes possession of our
hearts, and makes them new. Take your decision
to Him, and He will help you.</p>

<p><i>Helen</i> from New York. I am much interested
in your society. I think you must have a very
ingenious leader, to plan amusement for you.
All the pledges, too, are important. I feel sure
there must be some happy mothers in your
neighborhood; for I have observed they are
always glad when they see improvements in
their children. I hope you will write us often;
and give us the benefit of any new ideas which
you get.</p>

<p><i>Julia</i> from Colorado. Oh, yes, we like to hear
about the mountain scenery in your grand State.
I am glad you give time and thought to the
mountains, for they are among the wonderful
works of God. Have you ever noticed what
beautiful Bible verses there are about mountains?
Once I made a copy of them all, and
enjoyed it much. We shall always be glad to
hear from you.</p>

<p><i>Walter</i> from Massachusetts. Indeed you can
"belong!" Boys used to be rather scarce in
our society. I used often to wonder why they
were not so eager to overcome their faults as
girls seemed to be. But we have a great army
of them now. Your pledge is very important.
I am sure "mamma" will rejoice; and watch
your improvement with a thankful heart.</p>

<p><i>Edna</i> from Iowa. Indeed I think you wrote
a very nice letter. So you want to "shoot" a
great many things, do you? I think, with you,
it is very wise to overcome the habit of using
that, or any other by-word. To say the least,
it is inelegant; and Pansy Blossoms should be
very elegant, to match their lovely dress, and
general appearance.</p>

<p><i>Louie</i> from Maine. Dear little seven-year-old
Blossom, we welcome you with pleasure.
Do the weeds of cross words trouble you?
They are very poisonous weeds; I would be
glad if they were rooted out of all the heart-gardens
in the world. Look well after yours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
my dear, and there will be fewer than ever
before.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V. R.</i> from Florida. Thank you, dear
friend, for your sweet bright letter, and for
joining our P. S. and so giving aid and comfort
to the many little feet that are treading the same
road. Indeed I know, by experience, that if
any one in the world has need of patience, and
finds it hard to lay in enough for each day's supply,
it is a mother. If all the mothers would join
us in honest effort, it would be easier to lead the
children.</p>

<p><i>Lelia</i> from Minnesota. A "whining" flower!
Wouldn't that be a curiosity? I am so glad you
are working to overcome. I know ever so many
Blossoms who ought to join you in that pledge.
Can you not induce some of them to do so?</p>

<p><i>Louise</i> from Dakota. Here is another "careless"
Blossom whose temper also troubles her.
What an army of them we have! Every name
added to my roll gives me a feeling of satisfaction;
I know there is just so much less sorrow
in the world, because of each pledge.</p>

<p><i>Hattie</i> from Connecticut. Thank you, my
patient little girl, for being willing to wait your
turn for a letter. Not all the Blossoms are
so thoughtful. I shall now think of your
"things" as always in place. Shall I? How
pleasant that will be! For I know just how trying
it is to have them lying around where they
do not belong. I am glad you are also a little
worker for <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>.</p>

<h3><i>ABOUT BABIES.</i> (<i>Special to the P. S.</i>)</h3>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW, my Blossoms, here is business for
you. In the first place, pick out the
words which you think are improperly spelled;
count the number, and see if all the members of
your society agree with you. The next thing
is, to correct them. I hope I shall have some

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Dear Pansies</span>:</div>

<p>It was my indention to wright you about my
Journey north, this month, butt as nothing of
interest ocurred, I have desided to tel you of a
pretty little villiage where I once went to a
Sundy school meeting. It seems it was the
habbit of the peple to take the babies to Church,
and as, on that day it was not convient for eny
boddy to stay at home with them, fifteen babies
suceded in atending the meeting!</p>

<p>It was a verry plesent day out of doors; and
I could not help feeling sory for the poor babies,
because they were not out in the Sun shine.
They had a fassion of all talking at once; and
it was sometimes nesary for the speeker to
speek quite lowd in order to be herd.</p>

<p>While one man was telling a storry which of
coarse the babies did not understand, one of them
hoped up on the seet in front of me and began
a game of hide and seek. He was very still
about it, hiding his curly head on his mother's
sholder a minit, then bobing it up and looking
at me. He was so sweet I could not help
ansering him with a little smile, and a speck
of a nod, until sudenly his plesure became to
grate, and he shouted out "Peek-aboo!" Poor
baby! It realy was not his falt so mutch as
mine; and I realy suppose I ought to have been
the one to have been caried out in disgrase.
But I do not think his mother was seveer with
him, for I herd her not long afterwards, calling
him "Mamma's little hart seas!"</p>

<hr class="short" />

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Dear Pansy</span>:</div>

<p>I find so many letters in your magazine from
children that I can not forbear writing to you.</p>

<p>Although I am not a child, I think I am as
much interested in the magazine, and in the
Pansy Blossoms, as any child can be. Possibly
you will remember my writing you about the
organization of our Pansy Club. It has been a
success; the children are delighted with it.</p>

<p>Not long ago we gave an entertainment, followed
by refreshments&mdash;ice-cream, watermelon,
etc. We cleared a little over twenty-seven
dollars. The children sang a number of songs,
and recited selections, largely from <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>.
I wish you could have heard them! It seemed
to me that if I were not a Christian, the love
which sprang up in my heart that night for
those dear children, would have drawn me to
Jesus.</p>

<p>I have long felt as though my life was almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
a blank, but this P. S. has opened a way for me
to accomplish some good. I am anxious to do
good. I can meet those dear little ones in
grove, or hall, or parlor, from week to week
and perhaps sow a seed in some heart that shall
blossom for God.</p>

<p>At our entertainment, fifty children were in
the procession, and marched into church led by
a drum corps of little boys. Our banner is
made of cream-colored silk; arched over the top
in large blue letters are the words: "The Children's
Union Pansy Club." Underneath: "Our
Motto is to OVERCOME." In the centre, the
words: "For Jesus' Sake." At the left corner
there is a bouquet of pansies, painted in their
natural colors.</p>

<p>All the money we have saved, or earned, we
have appropriated to our pastor's salary, which
is small, and not paid regularly.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Dear Pansy</span>:</div>

<p>One night I was going down to the pasture
after the cow, and I saw Jip, our neighbor's
dog run, barking, into a clump of alders; so boy
fashion, I ran after him. As soon as I reached
the bushes, out came a rabbit; then Jip and I
joined in for a share of the fun. Jip caught him
by the hind leg and tossed him into a pile of
underbrush. The poor creature was so scared
that he crouched down and did not attempt to
stir. I caught him in my hands, and carried
him home. Papa fixed a barrel for me to put
him in. In the morning we built a pen for him
in the barn. At first he was very wild, and
would cry almost like a child; but I petted him
a great deal, and when he found I was always
kind, I could go in and lie down beside him on
the hay, and he would hop back and forth over
me.</p>

<p>I kept him for a month; then as winter was
coming, I thought I ought to let him go for fear
I could not get the right kind of food for him.
One day when I went to school I took him with
me. When I reached the woods, I put him on
the ground, but he would not go away from me.
I had to carry him away into the middle of the
woods; there I left him to find his old home.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Dear Pansy</span>:</div>

<p>I have wished, ever since the first number of
<span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> arrived, to try to thank you for
your goodness to the children; at this late date,
I have still nothing to offer save all the thanks
from each of our family circle, that can possibly
be crowded into one envelope.</p>

<p>We were snowbound all winter. <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>
was almost our only visitor, and the good things
it brings each month were devoured with such
eagerness and gusto as are possible only to those
who, like ourselves, have been famishing for
lack of mental food. I try hard to keep the
magazines clean, but they are read over and
over again, and the pictures inspected with ever
new delight; and they are in danger of being
worn to tatters. The mother, being only a child
of larger growth, enjoys the little books as much
as her bairns, and is in much more need of their
healthful and helpful teaching.</p>

<p>I find one needs all the help possible to keep
one's flag flying with its motto of "Onward,"
and its voice ever shouting "No surrender!"
And this, amid all the wounds which that merciless
tyrant, "Poverty," can inflict. May God
bless and reward you, is a loving mother's
prayer.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Dear Pansy</span>:</div>

<p>Here comes an old "Mother Pansy" of thirty-one
summers, to join the ranks of your thousands
of correspondents. I picture your smile of
amusement at the faded appearance which your
imagination must necessarily attribute to this
ancient flower, but I assure you her feelings and
desires for the happiness of the sweet young
Blossoms are as strong and fresh as they were
in her youthful days. Hence, by order of the
President of our Pansy Society, of which I am
Secretary, I must write you something of the
proceedings of said P. S. Our "Club" was
organized about a year ago and has been holding
regular weekly meetings since September
last, at which each member reads or recites some
instructive, moral and entertaining selection
often from your magazine, <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>. Our
Society consists of six members:</p>

<p>Charles T. Crawford, Pres., aged 12 years;
Mrs. Walter Crawford, Sec., 31; Blanchie Crawford,
10; Geo. W. Crawford, Treas., 8; Victorine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Crawford, 5; Jas. Warren Crawford, 2.
This is quite a "Crawford Clan" you see, and
quite a <i>home affair</i>, with regard to members
and meetings, but we are trying to make its influence
for good extend far and near.</p>

<p>At Christmas time we got together a large
lot of old toys, picture books, etc., with boxes of
cake and bonbons, and sent them to some poor
children in our community who were not able
to buy new ones. We also sent a box of Christmas
goodies to each of the <i>real old</i> ladies and
gentlemen living near us who were likely to be
overlooked in the overflow of young life surrounding
them. Also sent out some suitable
presents and eatables to needy negro families.
At our yesterday's meeting a motion was made,
seconded and voted in that as "St. Valentine's
Day" was near at hand, each member of the
Society prepare and send a Valentine to some
little child who would be likely to be forgotten
on this festive occasion. We gave to the "Missions"
last year and will give again during <i>this</i>.
<span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> has been a regular monthly visitor
here for the past four or five years, and we would
feel <i>very much</i> as if "one of the family" were
gone if we were deprived of it. Earnestly wishing
the progress of each P. S. in the wide
world and asking your own and their prayers
for the further success of ours,</p>

<h2>REPORT OF THE P. J. S.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the last three months the Pansy Junior
Society of Tompkinsville, Staten Island, N. Y.,
has entered into a new field of action, that of
specific work for others who have fewer advantages
than they.</p>

<p>Forty paper dolls have been made and dressed.
About one half of these are babies with one dress
each, the others being children each provided
with six dresses. Two china dolls have been
entirely fitted out, while others are in various
stages of completion.</p>

<p>Having heard of an invalid who was patching
a quilt and desired pretty pieces outlined in colors
for it, the Society decided to work a few for
her; five of these are already finished.</p>

<p>Up in Essex County, deep in among the
Adirondacks, lives a lovely Scotch lady who has
interested herself in the children of that region.
These little ones have absolutely nothing in the
line of reading, and by a unanimous vote of the
Society, it was decided to send them some nice
books and Sunday-School papers, thereby forming
the nucleus of a sort of circulating library, of
which the Scotch lady will be the head. We
hope, sometime in the near future, to open correspondence
with the children themselves, and
if possible, to start a branch of the P. S. in
Essex County.</p>

<p>The members of our Junior Society show
great interest in the work of subduing their
faults, and many have been the conquests over
self. Of course we all often forget, but frequently
the knowledge&mdash;and acknowledgment&mdash;of
our shortcomings, has but added fresh
earnestness to the desire not to be overcome.</p>

<p>At a recent meeting we decided to have a
motto, and the one chosen was, "For we are laborers
together with God." With this watchword,
and with the help of Him who is our Captain,
we intend to go on&mdash;and up.</p>

<h2>"THE CHILDREN OF WESTMINSTER
ABBEY."</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>HOW many of the Pansies know what
Westminster Abbey is? Of course a
large number of you little folks are not yet
acquainted with it. I don't know a pleasanter
way for people of your age to learn about it,
than to read the book bearing the title which I
have given above. Listen to what it says about
the building, "That Abbey is the record of
the growth of our two great nations. Within
its walls we are on common ground. America
is represented just as much as England. All
English and American boys and girls should
love Westminster Abbey." There are pictures
of the wonderful and beautiful building scattered
through the book; thirty-two illustrations,
in a book of two hundred and ninety-four pages.
It is almost like visiting the building itself, to
read about it in this book written by Rose
Kingsley. It is a beautifully bound volume, my
copy being in brown and gold. Usual price one
dollar. To members of the P. S. sixty cents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
In ordering from D. Lothrop &amp; Co., you must
not omit to say that you are entitled to the
book at the reduced price because you are an
enrolled member of the P. S.</div>

<p>With this introduction, I am going to let the
story speak for itself, by giving you a page or
two from it, together with the picture of "The
Cradle Tomb."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 279px;">
<img src="images/illus100.jpg" width="279" height="201" alt="photograph" />
<div class="caption">"THE CRADLE TOMB."</div>
</div>

<p>"On what used to be the altar step of the
north aisle of Westminster Abbey, stands a
baby's cradle&mdash;a cradle on real rockers. A
gorgeous coverlet, all trimmed with rich guipure
lace, falls from the corners of the cradle in splendid
rich folds. The arms of England, Scotland
and Ireland are carved on the back. And when
you look under the head of the cradle you see
that a baby lies sleeping in it. A darling tiny
baby it is&mdash;its little wee face set in a close lace
cap and lace ruff, under a kind of lace-trimmed
hood that forms part of the pillow. You can
almost fancy that if the cradle were set rocking,
the babe might open her eyes. But 'baby and
cradle, and all,' are marble&mdash;marble, yellow
with the dust and wear of nearly three hundred
years!</p>

<p>"'The Cradle Tomb' of Westminster, as it
is called, has been far better described than by
any words of mine. A card hangs close beside
it, placed there by desire of Lady Augusta
Stanley, on which is a poem by an American
lady. That lady is a well-known favorite of
American readers; for she is none other than
Susan Coolidge. And the lovely verses&mdash;some
of which I venture to transcribe&mdash;appeared in
<i>Scribner's Monthly</i> for 1875:</p>

<div class='poem'>
A little rudely sculptured bed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With shadowing folds of marble lace,</span><br />
And quilt of marble, primly spread,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And folded round a baby face.</span><br />
<br />
Smoothly the mimic coverlet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With royal blazonries bedight,</span><br />
Hangs, as by tender fingers set,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And straightened for the last good-night.</span><br />
<br />
And traced upon the pillowing stone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A dent is seen, as if, to bless</span><br />
That quiet sleep, some grieving one<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had leaned, and left a soft impress.</span><br />

<span class='gesp2'>........</span><br />

But dust upon the cradle lies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And those who prized the baby so,</span><br />
And decked her couch with heavy sighs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were turned to dust long years ago.</span><br />
</div>

<p>"The inscription on her cradle tells us that this
dear baby, 'Sophia, a royal rosebud, plucked
by premature fate, and snatched away from her
parents&mdash;James, King of Great Britain, France
and Ireland, and Queen Anne&mdash;that she might
flourish again in the rosary of Christ, was
placed here on the twenty-third of June, in the
fourth year of the reign of King James, 1606.'</p>

<p>"The little creature was born on the twenty-first
of June at Greenwich&mdash;a favorite palace
of the English sovereigns. Great preparations
had been made for her christening, and for the
tourneys which were to be held at the same
time in honor of her grandfather the King of
Denmark's visit. But the baby only lived two
days, and was hastily baptized 'Sophia,' after
the Queen of Denmark. James the First gave
orders that she should be buried 'as cheaply as
possible, without any solemnity, or funeral.'
Nevertheless he made a contract with Nicholas
Poutrain, the royal sculptor, for her monument,
the cost of which was not to exceed one hundred
and forty pounds. And we find that her
coffin was very solemnly conveyed up the river
by barge, covered with black velvet, accompanied
by three other barges covered with black
cloth and bearing many nobles, lords, ladies, and
the officers-of-arms, to the Parliament stairs at
Westminster. Thence the procession went to
the southeast door of the Abbey, where it was
met by the great lords of the Council, the Heralds,
and chief officers of the court."</p>

<p>No one need be without
a microscope. We
have made special arrangements
by which we
can offer a Combination
Microscope (or Floroscope),
2 inches in
length. It has in addition
to a powerful microscope
lens, a mineral glass for examining plants, minerals, etc. It is very
convenient. It can be put into a vest pocket, and yet is as serviceable as many
more expensive microscopes. Price 50 cents.</p>

<p>The entire framework is made from Iron, painted
and Japanned black, and ornamented with red and gilt
stripes.</p>

<p>All parts made to interchange.</p>

<p>1. The Bearings to the Arms are carefully sized to
bring them in perfect line. (This is a vital point in the
construction of any Jig Saw.)</p>

<p>2. Each machine is provided with a Dust Blower,
which is a very great advantage.</p>

<p>3. Our machine has a jointed Stretcher Rod, which
allows the operator to throw the upper arm out of the
way when adjusting his work or saw. This joint also
permits the machine to work much more freely than
with a straight iron rod.</p>

<p>4. Our clamps have a hinged jaw which overcomes
the disagreeable raking overthrow of the blade, which
is unavoidable when the saws are secured rigidly to the
arms. Saw blades are not nearly so liable to break
when clamps have this joint. Thus a large percentage
of the expense of running the saw is saved. Besides
this the saw runs much easier, the swing coming at the
hinge instead of bending the blade with each stroke of
the saw.</p>

<p>5. The Balance wheel is 4<sup>1</sup><small>/</small><sub>4</sub> inches in diameter,
with a handsome spoke centre and Rim of Solid Emery.</p>

<p>6. The attachment for Drilling is on the Right Hand
Side of the machine, which, for convenience, is an obvious
advantage.</p>

<p>7. No Pins are used in the construction of this machine,
as we prefer the durability of nicely fitted screws
and bolts in securing each part.</p>

<p>While the New Rogers' Saw is very rich, though not gaudy in appearance, it has been more especially
our object to make, for the least possible money, a saw characterized for its Compactness, Strength,
and durability, ease of action, and firmness when in operation.</p>

<p>With each machine we give six Saw Blades, Wrench, Sheet of Designs and three Drill Points. The
Saw alone weighs 25 lbs.; Saw and Box together, 36 lbs.</p>

<p>Price of No. 2 Rogers' Saw, $4.00. This Saw is provided with a polished Tilting Table, heavily
nickel-plated. <b>Receiver to pay express or freight charges.</b></p></div>

<p>The mechanical plan of the SELF-INKING
PRESS is the same as with the hand inker except
that inking rollers are added to work by the
stroke of a lever. The advantage of a self inker
over a hand inker is mainly in speed, which is
increased because both hands are left free, one to
feed paper and one to work lever.</p>

<p>ALL EXCELSIOR PRESSES use ordinary
printers' type, as made in any part of the world.
No <span class="smcap">Excelsior Press</span> is <i>cheaply</i> made, but has
<i>steel</i> bearings, <i>best</i> of screws, etc. <b>All presses
print within 1/8 inch of full size
of chase as screws are used to lock up the forms.</b></p>

<p>Every Excelsior Press is fully warranted in every respect. With every
press we send out is included full printed instructions on every point, by
which any purchaser can manage type-setting, press-work, etc., successfully
and satisfactorily.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>

<p>Young people are born naturalists. Their first inquiries are
in regard to the attractive objects of nature around them; and
their future mental activity&mdash;or stupidity&mdash;depends largely
upon the answers they receive. <i>Parents</i> and <i>teachers</i> should,
therefore, be able to encourage and satisfy the first cravings of
their inquiring minds. To aid in this, and to afford abundant
entertainment more pleasing than toys, far cheaper and more
instructive than mere amusement, we have secured a large quantity
of the Rocky Mountain Cabinets expressly for our special
premium use. Each Juvenile Cabinet contains 4 specimens of
gold, 3 of silver, 1 zinc, 1 lead, 3 iron, 2 copper ores&mdash;each a
different variety&mdash;1 agate (surface polished), opalized wood,
rock crystal, silicified wood, molydenum, Iceland spar, topaz, 2
jaspers, dendrite, tourmaline, opal agate, arragonite, milky
quartz, sulphur, selenite, Amazon stone, feldspar, fluorspar,
variscite, chalcedony, petrified wood, alabaster, mica, wavellite,
etc. The specimens in this cabinet are in a strong pasteboard
box, divided into 40 sections (size 8-1/2 by 6-1/2 inches) in
which the objects are affixed. A descriptive manual is sent
with each cabinet, giving the history, properties and uses of the
different minerals and gems. Price 85 cents postpaid.</p>

<div class='adtitle3'>BOOK-RACKS FOR EVERY HOME.</div>

<p>These Book-racks are something entirely new; something which everybody
needs.</p>

<p>Many people having a taste for reading, are prevented from purchasing
book-cases on account of their high cost. Consequently their books will lie
around on tables, on the floor or in closets until they become soiled or destroyed.
This difficulty in keeping books from being injured can be obviated
by obtaining the "Lock Shelf Book-rack," an article both beautiful and useful.</p>

<p>The simplicity of their construction will enable any one to take them apart
and put them up again in a moment's time. They are made to hang on the
wall from strong screw hooks which are furnished with each rack. (Put
hooks close to the uprights.) Can also stand on the floor.</p>

<div class='center'><br />A GOOD SUGGESTION.</div>

<div class='poem'>
Economy, as wise folks say,<br />
Is wealth pronounced another way,<br />
So while "hard times" the people cry,<br />
The Toilet Soaps they should not buy,<br />
Let all who buy such Soaps take care<br />
To weigh the cake exact and fair,<br />
And find the pay in figures round<br />
A dollar, more or less, per pound.<br />
What course should people then pursue?<br />
In short, the only thing to do,<br />
Though rich in bonds, or worldly poor,<br />
The "<span class="smcap">Ivory Soap</span>" they should procure,<br />
Which may be bought from coast to coast,<br />
At sixteen cents per pound at most,<br />
And does more satisfaction grant<br />
Than all the Toilet Soaps extant.<br />
</div>


<div class='center'><br />A WORD OF WARNING.</div>

<p>There are many white soaps, each represented to be "just as good as the
'Ivory';" they ARE NOT, but like all counterfeits, lack the peculiar and remarkable
qualities of the genuine. Ask for "Ivory" Soap and insist upon getting it.</p>
